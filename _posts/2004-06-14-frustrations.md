For a while it seemed that we might be on the verge of getting caught up with the myriad host of tasks we have piled up to prepare to leave for the year. But no &#8211; fate had more in store for us. First, just as we started actually packing last week, our air conditioning system expired in the middle of a really really _really_ hot week. And of course our house was built with some kind of bizarre heat-attracting design that seems to suck heat up and _never_ let it go &#8211; after a hot day the house can stay at 80&#176;F until midnight, even with fans running.

So of course we had to interrupt all our preparations and move in with our in-laws, just to keep breathing. And that disturbed everything. We&#8217;ve been almost completely unproductive since then. And what time we can find, we have to spend looking for someone to replace our HVAC system! What a **pain** _that_ is! The HVAC market seems to be murkier than any I&#8217;ve encountered yet &#8211; more than even cars or computers or insurance!

And **then** I dropped a chair on Elina&#8217;s foot, so she&#8217;s on crutches now and in pain, and **then**I had a roofer stop by to give me an estimate to repair some gutters and whatnot, and he shows me that my entire roof is shot, is leaking, is thrown on top of three or four _other_ roofs, which is criminally bad, and it might cost from eight to _twelve thousand dollars_!!!!

What&#8217;s next?

I happened to be listening to a segment of the radio program The World called Global Hit. [This segment](http://www.theworld.org/globalhits/2006/08/04.shtml) happened to be about Trikitixa, which is the name of a genre and the type of accordian used in this Basque folk music. It specifically profiles Iker Goenaga. I really liked the sound of this music and I&#8217;d love to find some more of it. No luck yet.

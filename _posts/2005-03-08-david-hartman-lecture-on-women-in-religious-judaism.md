I went to my first (and last, for this year) David Hartman lecture last night at the [Shalom Hartman Institute](http://www.hartmaninstitute.com/). I would try to recap the content but [Allison already did it for me](http://allisonjulia.typepad.com/allis_nesiya/2005/03/what_david_hart.html). So if you want my impressions, read her recap and see my comment below her post.

The only thing I didn&#8217;t mention in my comment is that while Hartman was expressing many admirable sentiments about women and their place in religion, his language could still use some work to be more inclusive. One particular phrase that stood out was something like: &#8220;What do you mean she is just doing whatever she wants? **I allow her!**&#8221; Yeah, that was a bit jarring.

Well, that&#8217;s your update for today. I&#8217;m Avi Flax, your liberal leftist feminist nut, reporting from Jerusalem.

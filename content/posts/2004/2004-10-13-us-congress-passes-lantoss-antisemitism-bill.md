Arutz Sheva [reports](http://www.israelnationalnews.com/news.php3?id=70296) that the US Congress has passed a bill condemming antisemitism, and encouraging the State Department to create an office to monitor it worldwide. It&#8217;s a nice gesture but it doesn&#8217;t really have teeth. Not all that surprising.

As noted at [Israpundit](http://israpundit.com/archives/009055.html).

After trying [HyperEdit](http://www.tumultco.com/HyperEdit/), [Taco HTML Edit](http://www.tacosw.com/), [CreaText](http://creatext.sourceforge.net/), [SubEthaEdit](http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/), [Smultron](http://smultron.sourceforge.net/), and others, I think I&#8217;ve finally settled on [jEdit](http://www.jedit.org/). It&#8217;s got everything I need: Free, [Open Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source), extendable, highly customizable, great php and xhtml syntax highlighting, well-integrated with [OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) but still multi-platform, and a great FTP plugin for direct editing on a site.

Smultron definitely gets a close second, and HyperEdit has a great concept with its live PHP previews. jEdit just happens to most closely fit my needs at the moment. Check out some screenshots: [1](http://www.jedit.org/index.php?page=screenshot&image=22), [2](http://www.jedit.org/index.php?page=screenshot&image=23), [3](http://www.jedit.org/index.php?page=screenshot&image=27), [4](http://www.jedit.org/index.php?page=screenshot&image=15).

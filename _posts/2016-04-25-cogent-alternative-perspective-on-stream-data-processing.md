I just re-read this fantastic article: [The world beyond batch: Streaming 101 by Tyler Akidau](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-world-beyond-batch-streaming-101) (August 2015) and realized that it provides a super-helpful “alternative” perspective on stream data processing, whereby “alternative” I mean my own perspective to date has been firmly aligned with the folks who created Kafka and Samza while they were at LinkedIn, in particular Martin Kleppmann and Jay Kreps.

Akidau, OTOH, has worked for years on data processing systems at Google, including MillWheel, and Cloud Dataflow, and [Apache Beam](http://www.datanami.com/2016/04/22/apache-beam-emerges-ambitious-goal-unify-big-data-development/). I could be wrong but I think his ideas provide a helpful and compatible counterpoint to those of the Kafka-oriented crowd.

I’ve added this to [my stream data reading list](https://gist.github.com/aviflax/7f453a41a06a200a2f5d#file-reading-list-md). I haven’t yet read [part 102](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-world-beyond-batch-streaming-102) but I suspect it might be similarly illuminating.

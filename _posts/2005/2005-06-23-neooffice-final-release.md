[NeoOffice &#8211; OpenOffice.org for Mac OS X](http://www.neooffice.org/) has released its first Final Release &#8211; if you already use a beta version, you should upgrade, and if you don&#8217;t use it, you should try it!

From the site:

> NeoOffice/J is a full featured office productivity suite including word processing, spreadsheet, presentation, vector drawing, database, and macro functionality. It can be used as a free alternative to Microsoft Office:Mac. You can exchange documents with Microsoft Office and OpenOffice.org users, even on other platforms!

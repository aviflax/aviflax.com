I&#8217;ve been real busy beating myself over the head trying to finish these essays for the [Pardes](http://pardes.org.il/) application. No matter how much I try to convince myself that it&#8217;s ok, there&#8217;s no rush, I&#8217;m just a little sick of myself about it. Today my deadline to finish them is midday Sunday, partially because we&#8217;re going to a talk Sunday evening at Pardes about Post-Zionism.

Some highlights of the past week:

  * Spent an hour yesterday falling and being kicked, punched, and otherwise pummeled at Jerusalem Dojo &#8211; actually, being taught [Jujitsu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiu_jitsu) (or Jiu jitsu, or &#26580;&#34899;) by [Akiva](http://www.jujitsu.org.il/english/akiva.asp). I liked it, and I think I&#8217;ll be going back. Thanks to Joey for finding the place!
  * Spent two hours last night at a discussion group in a coffee shop kinda place called The Living Room, it&#8217;s in the windmill in Rehavia, on Rehov Ramban (yes, _in_ the windmill). The topic was &#8220;Are Men & Women Created Equal?&#8221; I guess I should have realized from the title, the discussion was focused mostly on the creation story of men & women from the Torah, while what I&#8217;m really more interested in these days is contemporary feminism and gender issues. But it caught my eye so I checked it out. The format has potential, but I felt that somehow the discussion was a bit Orthodox- and &#8220;Frum&#8221;- centric &#8211; can&#8217;t explain exactly what I mean, but it bugged me a little. 
    I spent some time chatting with Yossi, the owner (who also owns [Wolf & Lamb](http://www.shamash.org/cgi-bin/kosher/kosscan.pl?Recno=01268&Comm=two) in NYC) &#8211; he and his wife are hoping to make The Living Room into a spot for english-speaking 20-30-somethings to sip some coffee while discussing Torah, Judaism, philosophy, etc, or hearing some live music or a poetry reading (I think). Interesting idea, has potential.
    
    Lest I forget: I also met another fellow [Pardes](http://pardes.org.il/) student at this thing: Luke, who&#8217;s from Chicago and seemed like a real nice guy. Looking forward to hanging out with him again.</li> 
    
      * On Sunday evening Elina and I took a short trip to Tel Aviv to check out a stereo that someone had posted on [Janglo](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/janglo/) &#8211; turned out to be a decent set, a [Teac receiver](http://www.teac.com/ConsumerAudio/Receivers/AG-D7900.htm) with some KLH speakers. I was pretty dubious about KLH, but after hearing them I decided that they were acceptable. It&#8217;s really nice to have music in our place, it was the biggest thing missing at that point. Now we&#8217;ve got it all hooked up to our [Airport Express](http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/), streaming music wirelessly, and lovin&#8217; it!</ul> 
    
    &#8230;I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s more, but it&#8217;s not coming to me &#8211; right now, the rest of the past week seems like one big blur. Oh well, Shabbat Shalom!

I&#8217;ve finally installed a system to manage news here. I decided to try [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) instead of [Moveable Type](http://moveabletype.org/), since WP runs on [PHP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP) (which I am currently learning) and MT runs on [Perl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl).

Having this system means that friends and family will be able to post comments on our posts, which can in effect become little mini-discussions. Perhaps more significant, people can now subscribe to our [RSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss) feed to be notified of updates to the site, instead of checking at random intervals.

To be notified of updates to this site, I recommend [BlogLines](http://www.bloglines.com) &#8211; it&#8217;s a great service. It keeps a list of all the websites that you&#8217;re interested in, and you can [download a tiny little tool](http://www.bloglines.com/about/notifier) that will tell you when any of those sites has an update, and there are versions for almost every [OS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system).

Check out a [screenshot](images/bloglines_large.jpg).

Of course, you can also use any other RSS-enabled blogreader, aggregator, notifier, tool, etc. The URL of our RSS update feed is <http://flaxfamily.com/blog/wp-rss2.php>.

BTW, if you&#8217;re curious about what exactly a blog is, check out [the great wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog).

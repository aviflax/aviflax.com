This was my Dad&#8217;s house &#8211; (he passed away in August 2002) &#8211; click on the photo and you&#8217;ll see that it&#8217;s listed for sale by [Bondar Realty](http://www.homesdatabase.com/bondar/). I stumbled across it in Bondar&#8217;s [listings](http://www.homesdatabase.com/bondar/).

This just feels strange.

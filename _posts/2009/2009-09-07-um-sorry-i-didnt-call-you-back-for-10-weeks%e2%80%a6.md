I just figured out that my voicemail hasn&#8217;t worked for a while… a quick Google search, and doh! I realize it&#8217;s been since I set up the AT&T tethering hack. And yeah, that&#8217;s about 10 weeks… once I finally got it fixed, 28 messages popped up. Oops!

It took me a while, but eventually I got my Visual Voicemail working again. I&#8217;m recording the steps here for posterity.

Hint: if your Visual Voicemail ever seems like it might not be working, you can always access your voicemail by switching to the Keypad and holding down the &#8220;1&#8221; key.

At this point, there are a bunch of different ways to install a tethering hack — basically, there&#8217;s multiple hacks. I can&#8217;t even find the link to the hack I originally used. So, **YMMV**. 

Here&#8217;s what worked for me and _might_ work for you:

  1. Launch the Settings app
  2. Click on General → Network → Cellular Data Network
  3. Under &#8220;Visual Voicemail&#8221;, make sure that the value of APN is `acds.voicemail` If it isn&#8217;t, make it so.
  4. Turn off the phone
  5. Follow the steps in [this article](http://www.macworld.com/article/141278/2009/06/visualvoicemail.html) to reset your voicemail password
  6. Turn the phone back on
  7. Once the phone boots, open the Phone app, and click on the Voicemail tab
  8. Hopefully, the Voicemail tab will be showing the setup screen. Enter a password and set up a greeting, and once you&#8217;re done, all your queued up voicemail messages should appear.

Sorry for the tardy post. Somehow it just totally slipped my mind to post this one.

That week&#8217;s Torah portion included the phrase &#8220;a wise heart&#8221; so Ilene asked us to write something about that idea:

> “Wise Heart?
> 
> What the heart knows it doesn&#8217;t tell
  
> But slowly metes out
  
> a glucose drip of love
> 
> or poison, when it hurts so bad
  
> that you know you have to turn back, turn around
  
> and return to the one you should never have left
> 
> Is it fair for my heart to be wiser than me?
  
> It could at least let me in on its secrets
  
> After all, it lives in my chest.
> 
> But no, it demands space, independence
  
> It wants to pump by its own rules, its own drummer
  
> It&#8217;ll give it up when it&#8217;s nice and ready
  
> or to stop me from my big mistakes.
> 
> My heart nudges me this way and that
  
> and I try to follow, I strain to see past my blinders
  
> to know what it&#8217;s keeping from me
  
> But always it keeps its wisdom
  
> to itself
  
> I think I&#8217;m starting to accept this
  
> We all have our secrets
  
> My heart will open up
  
> when we trust each other 

and some good feedback:

N1: likes heart vs self, non integrated, keeping secrets. But how does that work with heart inside my chest. Likes casual language, modern slang, pump, give it up, serious topic, but like a conversation. Could play more with physical images, binding, attaching. What is the substance of the rest of the person that is not heart? Mind, spirit? Counter voice? 

Y: liked seperation. The glucose drip was very clear and specific, and the rest is more lyrical.

I: maybe don&#8217;t need the “drummer? cliché, it&#8217;s it&#8217;s own cliché not yours, maybe your own words alone would be stronger. Also, blindness could use a little more explication, fleshing out. Like at the end got to the second person, i&#8217;m referring to someone. There&#8217;s a confusion, switch of tense. Compared to “going back to you?

N2: interesting notion of seperation, explore it more, what&#8217;s the existensial meaning of me in one place and my heart in another?

The second exercise from this meeting isn&#8217;t ready to post, although I may try to continue working on it in the future.

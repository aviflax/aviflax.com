Subject: Please Remove Hate Sources

Dear [Google News](http://news.google.com/),

Please remove [Jihad Unspun](http://www.jihadunspun.com/) and [National Vanguard](http://www.nationalvanguard.org/) from your list of news sources. These organizations promote hatred and racism and are not legitimate news providers.

If your service is to remain useful, reliable, and respectable, it must err on the side of caution in choosing valid and reliable news sources. If these organizations are not removed soon from your source list, I will cease to use Google News.

Thank you,
  
Avi Flax

Yesterday I learned via [this answer](https://discuss.atom.io/t/a-way-to-exclude-folders-from-find-in-project/9861/6) a handy [Atom](https://atom.io) trick: one can exclude directories from the _Find in Project_ feature by prefixing them with an exclamation mark, like so: `!dir`

This is handy when a project contains “archived” (frozen) files, or a generated dir like Jekyll’s `_site`.

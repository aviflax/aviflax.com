Chas Emerick just posted [the 2012 State of Clojure Survey](http://cemerick.com/2012/07/19/2012-state-of-clojure-survey/), which I promptly filled out. I&#8217;m pretty excited about this language and community right now.

Most of my answers were pretty boring, save perhaps the one to the question of what Clojure’s weakest area is.

My answer:

> The docs, while promising, still need work. ClojureDocs.org is great but out of date. And it&#8217;s really hard, when learning the language, to discover which functions/macros/patterns are available to accomplish a given algorithmic task. For now, Stack Overflow seems to be the best option.

I think that _that_ is the weakest area I could think of — and I&#8217;ve been actively building software with Clojure — shows how mature and robust this language and community is. (Either that, or I&#8217;m just a softie, or I haven&#8217;t dug deeply enough yet.)

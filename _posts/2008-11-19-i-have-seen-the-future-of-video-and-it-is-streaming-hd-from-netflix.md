I just installed the latest XBox 360 update, which added Instant Netflix TV and movie streaming to my XBox. Instant Netflix doesn&#8217;t yet indicate which movies are HD and which are SD, so I just randomly started The Host, and it came in in HD – lucky choice! The movie started quickly, and the picture and sound were perfect. This is just such a great way to watch movies!

I love that Instant Netflix is a subscription model, where we pay X dollars per month for our subscription – as little as $9 – and that includes instant streaming of any movie or TV show in their instant catalog. While I was never a fan of the model for music, such as Rhapsody, it works great for movies and TV shows, because I&#8217;m much less likely to watch a movie over and over again than I am to listen to a song over and over again. In other words, I want to build a collection of music which I own, but I just want to be able to watch movies and TV shows once or occasionally twice.

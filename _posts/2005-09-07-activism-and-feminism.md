&#8230;but not necessarily together.

Two posts worth reading at [Mad Melancholic Feminista](http://melancholicfeminista.blogspot.com/):

[On Activism and Small Towns](http://melancholicfeminista.blogspot.com/2005/08/on-activism-and-small-towns.html) is a reflection by an academic feminist on her attempts to disseminate her views to the actual non-academic residents of her town. Some interesting thoughts on the challenges of being a &#8220;liberal&#8221; in the contemporary US.

[What it means to be real](http://melancholicfeminista.blogspot.com/2005/08/what-it-means-to-be-real-guest-blog.html) is a post by guest blogger Gburgkid, &#8220;a young, idealistic, male feminist,&#8221; on gender, identity, and society in&#8230; the contemporary US.

It&#8217;s good stuff, but writing &#8220;the contemporary US&#8221; twice in a row has me wondering whether it&#8217;s possible to get a somewhat more global eye on these issues&#8230;. or not?

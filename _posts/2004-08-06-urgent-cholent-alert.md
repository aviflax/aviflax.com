[The Kosher Blog](http://www.kosherblog.net/index.php?itemid=182) alerts us to a recall of crock-pots by Rival.

Quote from the [CPSC alert:](http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml04/04193.html)

> Hazard: The handles on the base of the slow cookers can break, posing a risk of burns from hot contents spilling onto consumers.

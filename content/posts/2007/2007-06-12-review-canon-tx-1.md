Elina and her parents gave me this exciting new camera for my birthday. It was a great gift &#8211; just what I wanted. Unfortunately, I had put it on [my wishlist](http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/2138CIJ4L7690/) before any reviews had been released &#8211; I was that enticed by its ground-breaking feature set. Once it finally arrived, I found that the camera&#8217;s image quality didn&#8217;t match its feature set; it just wasn&#8217;t satisfying. So, with Elina&#8217;s approval, I&#8217;m exchanging it for&#8230; something else. Can you guess what?

I figured I may as well try to help out others who are considering the TX-1, so I posted a review  [at Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PCNK1LQXB2GV/ref=cm_cr_auth/104-7773363-1553558?ie=UTF8&sort%5Fby=MostRecentReview) and [at dpreview](http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/read_opinion_text.asp?prodkey=canon_tx1&opinion=36412).

I was surprised to see that most other reviews have been mostly positive. Even the generally critical dpreview was fairly easygoing in [their review](http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canontx1/), although their conclusion was an unflattering &#8220;Recommended (but only just)&#8221;. I don&#8217;t know, maybe I had higher expectations, or maybe I&#8217;ve just been spoiled by the image quality of our Nikon D80 and Canon SD600.

Here&#8217;s the full text of my review:
  
<!--more-->

> I was very excited about this camera when it was first announced &#8211; finally, HD-quality video in my pocket! 10x optical zoom, optical image stabilization, excellent! And I&#8217;ve always been a huge fan of Canon&#8217;s SD series &#8211; tiny pocket-cams which take great stills and decent video. This seemed like the next step &#8211; great stills and great video too. So I pre-ordered the camera as soon as I could, and waited eagerly for it to ship. And waited, and waited&#8230;
> 
> When the camera finally arrived, I was surprised at the bulk and heft of it. Sure, it&#8217;s still highly compact, but for someone used to the SD300 and SD600, this is a step backwards in portability. It makes my pockets kinda bulge. Right off the bat, strike one: my primary use case for the camera was to keep it in my pocket all the time. Once I tried it though, I realized that it&#8217;d have to go in a bag most of the time.
> 
> Strike two: it&#8217;s kinda awkward to hold. I have very large hands, so I rarely have a problem with any camera. I&#8217;m not sure if others would have the same experience, but it&#8217;s worth noting, since I&#8217;ve always been comfortable with various other Canons, Nikons, and Pentaxes.
> 
> Finally, my main criticism, Strike 3: Picture Quality. I wasn&#8217;t happy with either the stills or the video. With the stills, I had trouble with the focus system. The face-tracking system seems useful at first, but when I viewed the photos on my computer, the focus never seemed quite right. Even when I switched to a more conventional focus mode, the picture quality just wasn&#8217;t as satisfying as that of the SD600, an older and cheaper model.
> 
> Video quality was, for me, the last straw. Sure, it may be technically HD, but for me, HD promises more than just resolution. When I think HD, I think sharp, clear, and vibrant. The video produced by the TX1 is high-resolution, it is wide-screen at 16&#215;9 &#8211; but it&#8217;s not really HD. The video picture is blotchy and fuzzy, and really no better than that, again of a much cheaper SD series camera. It&#8217;s nice that it&#8217;s wide, the video is definitely much better proportioned for today&#8217;s wide-screen televisions, but it&#8217;s not much of an advance beyond that, and it certainly isn&#8217;t really HD.
> 
> Also worth noting is that the video files produced by the TX-1 are immense, making it fairly inconvenient and/or expensive to use as a video camera. These file sizes certainly aren&#8217;t justified by the video quality.
> 
> To sum up: the TX-1 has an impressive array of features, and had the potential of being a truly groundbreaking device, of finally bringing HD video and stunning stills into a single pocketable device. Unfortunately, however, it doesn&#8217;t deliver on quality, and it&#8217;s not as pocketable as its predecessors, which take better stills and video that&#8217;s nearly as good as the TX-1&#8217;s.
> 
> Ultimately, for me, the TX-1 wasn&#8217;t satisfying as a still camera or a video camera. I&#8217;ve returned mine; I&#8217;m going to stick with my SD600 for now.
> 
> I&#8217;m still eagerly awaiting the first truly pocketable device which shoots both high-quality stills and video. I&#8217;d even be willing to pay more than I did for the TX-1 &#8211; maybe that would give it a better chance of succeeding. In the meantime, I&#8217;ve got my eye on the Canon HV10 HD Camcorder to supplement my SD600 and Nikon D80.

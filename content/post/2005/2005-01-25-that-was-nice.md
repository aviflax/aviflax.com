I&#8217;m working in a café today (Tal Bagels) and I&#8217;m at a little table in the back, just workin away. It&#8217;s a pretty good setup in a nice place &#8211; until someone at the table next to mine pulled out a pack and lit up a cigarette. It&#8217;s funny, my Dad smoked so I was around cigarettes most of my life &#8211; but I can&#8217;t stand them. I really dislike the smell and the sensation of breathing the smoke.

Now, there is a law in Israel that proscribes smoking in public establishments such as cafés and restaurants &#8211; but it&#8217;s only spottily enforced. It&#8217;s a culture thing. People frequently just let this kind of thing slide or ignore it, so as to avoid a hassle or making a ruckus or anything like that.

Another factor is that many perceive a certain stubbornness and scofflaw streak in the common Israeli psyche.

So I tried being patient for a while, until he lit up the second or third cigarette. At that point I was annoyed, and the option of asking the owner of the café to deal with it crossed my mind. But I told myself that it would be far more considerate to appeal directly to my fellow patron first, and give him a chance to respond directly to me instead of going through an authority figure.

Here&#8217;s the nice part &#8211; as soon as I asked him to take the cigarette outside, he did. No fuss, no muss. He was nice about it and there was no hassle at all.

Sometimes it&#8217;s worthwhile to test those stereotypes &#8211; you never know when people might break them.

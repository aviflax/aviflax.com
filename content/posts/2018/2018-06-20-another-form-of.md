title: Another form of the same failure mode

Following up on [my prior post](http://blog.aviflax.com/2018/06/20/when-will-i.html), I just realized (while in a 1:1 with a friend) that this failure mode of mine really has _two_ forms — and I stumble into both all too often.

Both forms involve omitting a crucial step when defining and pursuing a course of work/action.

The prior form omits the breaking of an ambitious, compelling vision into small, incremental, safe, achievable steps, and deploying them independently.

In the other form, I’ll propose or pursue a course of work comprising _only_ small, incremental, safe, achievable steps, while omitting the crucial vision. This violates the adage “Make no little plans; they have no magic to stir men's blood and probably will not themselves be realized.” ([Daniel Burnham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Burnham#Influence))

I wonder if the fundamental error in both cases is impatience.

Either way, I’m going to try hard to reduce the frequency of my failures in both forms of this mode.

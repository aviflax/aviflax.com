Flight wasn&#8217;t too bad, and now we&#8217;re chilling with Jackie in her place in Weehawken, NJ. Headed down to Bmore later this afternoon to hang out with the neice & nephew (and their parents) and all the family. We should be in Bmore at least through the weekend; at the moment we&#8217;re still reachable via voicemail on our home number or email, but we should have a temporary mobile number soon.

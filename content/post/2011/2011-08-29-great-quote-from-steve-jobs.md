[Via](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/08/29/ideas-hierarchy) Daring Fireball, from [an interview](http://thesmallwave.com/ideas-not-hierarchy-on-steve-jobs-supposedly) by Walt Mossberg:

<blockquote cite="http://thesmallwave.com/ideas-not-hierarchy-on-steve-jobs-supposedly">
  <p>
    If you want to hire great people and have them stay working for you, you have to let them make a lot of decisions and you have to, you have to be run by ideas, not hierarchy. The best ideas have to win, otherwise good people don&#8217;t stay.

After a 5 year hiatus, I&#8217;m racing again! I raced our brand-spanking-new Subaru Legacy GT (1,006 miles!) today at an autocross event organized by the [Westchester Sports Car Club](http://www.wscc.org/) in Pomona, New York. It was a blast, and I even came in 2nd place in my class!

Elina came along and it was great to have her there with me, she’s such an energetic supporter. She was tempted to drive herself, but in the end decided to err on the side of caution, given that she’s 6 months pregnant. She did take some good photos though, such as this one:

I’m really happy to finally be racing again, and I’m eagerly awaiting my next event!

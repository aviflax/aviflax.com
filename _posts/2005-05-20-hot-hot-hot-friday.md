We are melting! Wrong day to spend two hours in the shuk around noon. As usual it&#8217;s Friday afternoon, we have guests tomorrow, a Shabbaton to attend at Pardes in a few hours, and tons more to do. Sorry if we owe you a phone call&#8230; it&#8217;s hard enough just to keep moving!

Shabbat Shalom!

[This new episode](http://jpmedia.co/responsa-radio-56-protest-prayer/) of the excellent @HadarInstitute podcast Responsa Radio, _Is Protest Prayer?_, is super timely given that @AMarch4OurLives is next Shabbat:

> Rabbis Avi Killip and Ethan Tucker discuss the questions: "What are we doing when we protest?" and "Is protest different when it happens on Shabbat?"

BTW I’m very proud of my shul community at [The Hebrew Institute of White Plains](http://hiwp.org) for formally and prominently encouraging and supporting everyone to attend the march in White Plains. We’re having a special kiddush beforehand and then walking over to the march together!

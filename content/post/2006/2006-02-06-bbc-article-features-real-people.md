[Israel warns Abbas on Hamas ties](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4682484.stm) has two little links in the right-hand sidebar: [Israelis React](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/06/middle_east_israelis_react_to_hamas_win/html/1.stm) and [Palestinians Speak](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/06/middle_east_ramallah_reacts_to_hamas_win/html/1.stm).

It&#8217;s not exactly a new idea to feature feedback from people on the street, but &#8212; I like how this is done. There are an equal number of representatives from both sides, and each person has a good-sized photograph and a good 4-6 sentences &#8211; way better than a 5-word sound bite.

Of course we can&#8217;t assume that it&#8217;s a random sampling, there may be bias present in who was chosen and the photos taken and the text, etc, etc &#8212; as with any media piece. And the BBC doesn&#8217;t have a great record when it comes to the Israeli-Arab conflict &#8212; it&#8217;s HonestReporting&#8217;s [&#8220;>Dishonest Reporter of 2005](http://www.honestreporting.com/articles/45884734/critiques/The_Dishonest_Reporter_Award_2005.asp).)

Still, I like some aspects of this feature.

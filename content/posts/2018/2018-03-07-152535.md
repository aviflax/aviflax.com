[Deckset 2 is out!](https://www.decksetapp.com/2/) A compelling upgrade to an excellent Mac app. Itâ€™s for creating slide decks with Markdown. (ðŸ¤“ðŸš¨: Track changes to your talks in Git!) Iâ€™m excited to try the new customization features.

And notable: itâ€™s yet another great Mac app [leaving Appleâ€™s app store](https://twitter.com/decksetapp/status/971391922571952129).

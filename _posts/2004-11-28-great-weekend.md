On Friday we went for a tiyul with [Pardes](http://pardes.org.il) somewhere in the Jordan Valley to the north. We had an exhilarating hike on Friday and then a great shabbaton at a nearby kibbutz. (Update: the hike was at Sartaba, and the kibbutz was [Kibbutz Sheluchot](http://sites.tzofit.co.il/shluhot/))

Haven&#8217;t had a chance to upload the photos yet, but here&#8217;s a preview:

So what do y&#8217;all think of my new look?

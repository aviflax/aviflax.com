It&#8217;s just been one of those weeks! The furnace died, so no heat (just a space heater in our bedroom) &#8211; and our internet service went out over Shabbat. And our US phone uses the internet, so frustration there too.

Anyway, the internet is back as of now, and the phone along with it, so please feel free to call (tomorrow, we&#8217;re going to sleep now) &#8211; at least until the next outage.

The furnace should be back in commission tomorrow. About time!

It&#8217;s hard to believe, but it may be true. Here&#8217;s a breakdown of the rest of our time in Israel starting today:

  * Avi has 1 week of break, no visitors, Elina still in school
  * 2 weeks of Passover break for us both, with visitors (my Mom, cousin Rachel, Elina&#8217;s uncle Steve)
  * 4 weeks of School
  * 10 days to pack
  * 1 day of Shavuot

&#8230; and that&#8217;s it! We&#8217;re returning to the US the night after Shavuot. Wow.

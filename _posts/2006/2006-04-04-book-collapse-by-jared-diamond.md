I just posted this review to [the Amazon product page](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143036556):

> I don&#8217;t have the words to describe the value and significance of this book, I&#8217;ll let others do that. I just want to share one minor critique: at the end of the book Diamond gives some suggestions on what the average US citizen can do to improve humanity&#8217;s chances of surviving, and of not completely ruining our home. That&#8217;s a good idea and very important &#8212; one wants to take action after reading the book, but the whole problem does seem overwhelming &#8212; concrete suggestions are exactly what&#8217;s needed at that point.

> However, Diamond makes a mistake which I&#8217;ve found to be nearly universal in recommendations of this nature: he provides too many options. At the end of his list, I&#8217;m still almost as overwhelmed as before. OK, sure, I could try to pick just one of his suggestions, but &#8212; which one? I find myself confused and conflicted &#8212; not where I want to be. Sure, anything is better than nothing, but I want my efforts to be effectual, not semi-random.

> This actually connects very well to the next book I read: [The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060005688) by Barry Schwartz, which is helping me understand why I&#8217;m having this difficulty (of choosing a course of action), and what I might be able to do to get past it.

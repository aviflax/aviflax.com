I just started using [Evernote](http://evernote.com/), and it&#8217;s amazing. The automatic OCR is a _killer_ feature. It also has so many different interfaces: desktop, web, generic mobile, iPhone, and even IMAP; it&#8217;s amazing. The ability to email notes into notebooks, maintain multiple notebooks, save searches, and publicly publish notebooks &#8211; all combined, it&#8217;s an amazing system that is remarkably easy to use, considering the depth of its powerful features.

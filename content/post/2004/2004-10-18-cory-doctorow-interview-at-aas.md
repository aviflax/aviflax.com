All About Symbian [interviews Cory Doctorow](http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/features/viewarticle.php?id=110) (a role model of mine) a writer and member of the [EFF](http://www.eff.org) (Electronic Frontier Foundation, an organization that I support financially and otherwise). The interview focuses on Electronic Publishing, which I find particularly interesting today. Enjoy!

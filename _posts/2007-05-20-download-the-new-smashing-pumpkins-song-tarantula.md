[Download Tarantula by The Smashing Pumpkins (MP3)](http://aviflax.com/media/Smashing_Pumpkins_Zeitgeist_Tarantula.mp3)

(Right-click on the link and choose _download_ or _save as_.)

Tarantula, from [The Smashing Pumpkins](http://www.smashingpumpkins.com) upcoming new album Zeitgeist, was recently played on some radio stations, and a low-quality radio rip was posted for download. The music sounds promising, but the quality of the file was disturbingly bad.

Google helped me find a much cleaner version of the song [at Spinner.com](http://www.spinner.com/2007/05/18/new-music-tarantula-by-smashing-pumpkins/), but it was only available there in a streaming Flash format. I tried downloading and converting the FLV file (using [AddMovie](http://www.limit-point.com/Utilities.html#AddMovie)) but it came out kinda crackly. So I just went the brute-force route: I used [Audio Hijack](http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/) to rip the audio as it played in Safari, [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) to trim the resulting AIFF file, and iTunes to convert it to an MP3. Then, just for extra geek cred, I uploaded the file to [S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3) and I&#8217;m using an Apache rewrite to redirect hits to it there.

Just in case this post gets a lot of attention, I upgraded my blog software to the latest release, WordPress 2.2, which just came out last week, and installed both Google Analytics and WordPress.com Stats.

As for the song itself, so far I think I like it. The album&#8217;s looking quite promising!

Enjoy!

**Update:** Of course I spend two hours on this project, then I [find](http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2007/05/mp3_new_smashin.html#comment-219455) that [manyhighways](http://www.manyhighways.com/music/new_smashing_pumpkins_song.php) beat me to it. And they used [flv2mp3.com](http://flv2mp3.com) to convert the FLV file, which worked just fine. Ah well, I may not have done it first or best, but at least I tried to contribute.

The Stowaway line from [Think Outside](http://www.thinkoutside.com/index.html) includes a portable folding [Bluetooth keyboard](http://www.thinkoutside.com/stowawaybt_product.html) and an optical [Bluetooth travel mouse](http://www.thinkoutside.com/btmouse_product.html). Both are powered by AAA batteries. They both received favorable reviews at Geekzone: [keyboard](http://www.geekzone.co.nz/content.asp?contentid=2903), [mouse](http://www.geekzone.co.nz/content.asp?ContentId=3823). More reviews linked to on the product pages. I want them both!

If I combine these with a [Kensington Laptop Desktop USB](http://flaxfamily.com/index.php?p=63) ([review](http://www.gadgetmadness.com/archives/20041009-review_kensington_laptop_desktop_usb_20_docking_station.php), [review](http://www.rklau.com/tins/archives/2004/12/27/kensington_laptop_desktop.php)) maybe my irritating back pain will go away!

The mouse is $54 at [Beach Audio](http://www.beachaudio.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=41541&GCID=C12585x003&GTKW=msbtue). [PriceGrabber](http://pricegrabber.com/) lists the keyboard at $95, and the Laptop Desktop at $55 &#8211; all shipped to 21215.

I also just noticed the [IOGear Bluetooth mini mouse](http://iogear.com/main.php?loc=product&Item=GME225B) at [Buy.com](http://www.buy.com/retail/product_jump.asp?sku=10388574) for $43 shipped. This one might be a winner &#8211; it includes a rechargeable battery that charges via an included USB cable. Nice!

Oops, looks like Kensington [has one too](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00022TN7C/ref=pd_sbs_op_2/102-1171001-1670539?v=glance&s=electronics). Everyone&#8217;s in on the Bluetooth game! I like!

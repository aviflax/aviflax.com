[TextDrive](http://www.textdrive.com/) is our web hosting and email provider and they&#8217;re now offering [Hosting For Life](http://textdrive.com/vc3/) plans for the third time. A one-time $400 payment gets you an account that normally costs $250 a year. They&#8217;ve found this offer to be an effective way to raise capital quickly.

I am seriously tempted to sign us up, financially I think it makes a lot of sense. Unfortunately we don&#8217;t have the money right now! Damn, this kind of crap always happens &#8211; good opportunities arise, but the timing isn&#8217;t good. But two days in a row! Yesterday I posted at <flaxfamily.com> about a [great deal](http://flaxfamily.com/post/great-deal-on-digital-slr/) on a Canon digital SLR camera.

(And no, I haven&#8217;t yet worked out exactly what gets posted here at aviflax.com and what gets posted at flaxfamily.com. I think I posted the camera to ff.com because aviflax.com isn&#8217;t really up yet, and I wanted people to see it. That just tells me that I really need to get going and wrap up the site relaunches.)

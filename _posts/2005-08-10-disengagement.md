Well, this may be silly, but I just want to publicly declare somewhere my views on [Israel&#8217;s disengagement from Gaza](http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&edition=us&ie=ascii&q=gaza%20disengagement "Google News Search: gaza disengagement").

I support the disengagement, and I feel that it is the correct move for Israel at this time. I am sad that people must be removed from their homes, but I feel that it is unfortunately necessary.

I don&#8217;t have the time to fully explain my position right now, but I hope to do so soon in a follow-up post.

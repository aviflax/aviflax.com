[World of Goo](http://worldofgoo.com/) might just be the best game I&#8217;ve ever played. I just finished it, and I&#8217;m flabbergasted, amazed, delighted, awestruck by how incredibly good it is. It&#8217;s wonderful, amazing, brilliant, beautiful, spectacular, fun, deep, challenging, educational, funny, cute, tasteful&#8230; it&#8217;s a masterpiece. I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I laughed out loud while playing this game. And it was made by **four people** in coffee shops!

If you like or have ever liked video games, puzzles, construction toys such as Lego, physics, bridge-building competitions, or multimedia design, you should download the [demo](http://2dboy.com/games.php) for Mac or Windows, or just go ahead and [buy it](http://2dboy.com/games.php) &#8211; it&#8217;s $15 for the Wii, and $20 for Mac or Windows. I purchased the Mac version first, before the Wii version was available. Once the Wii version was released, I bought that as well, thinking that it might be really great. And it is!

I definitely recommend the Wii version, it&#8217;s my favorite. That said, now that I&#8217;ve beaten it on the Wii, I might start playing it more on the Mac, because only the Mac and PC versions can load custom levels made with [GooTool](http://goofans.com/gootool/), or [other mods](http://goofans.com/download). The fan community that has formed around this game is really impressive.

The New York Times recently posted a business-oriented [piece](http://www.nytimes.com/external/venturebeat/2009/01/02/02venturebeat-the-world-of-goo-became-one-of-the-indie-hi-102021.html) on the &#8220;independent&#8221; nature of the development of WoG. [David Rosen](http://vimeo.com/user768538), another &#8220;independent&#8221; video game developer, posted a [Design Tour of WoG](http://vimeo.com/2383388), which is fascinating but includes spoilers &#8211; so play the game before watching!

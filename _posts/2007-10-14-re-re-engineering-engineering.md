My letter was printed in the New York Times Magazine.

Before you read it, you should read at least the last two paragraphs of the article to which I was responding: [Re-engineering Engineering](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/30/magazine/30OLIN-t.html)

OK, now that you&#8217;ve done that, my letter, as printed:

> I was so engrossed and enthusiastic as I read John Schwartz’s article about Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering that when I reached the last two paragraphs, I was dismayed. The concerns of Richard K. Miller, the school’s president, about the employability of his students and about their prospects of clicking with the corporate culture of large firms resonated with me. The solution is for Olin to become not just a college but also a semi-independent engineering firm. Graduates could be guaranteed a two- or three-year position at the Olin firm, where they would execute real engineering work for paying clients in an environment that would serve as a bridge between college and their eventual independent careers. When they were ready to strike out on their own, graduates wouldn’t be looking for entry-level positions; they’d be established professional engineers with completed commercial projects on their résumés.

Elina didn&#8217;t make it to this one because of a cold. I had one too but I managed to get there.

Simon ran this meeting and it was a nice change. For the first exercise, he played the song Sweet Jane by The Velvet Underground and asked us to write something after hearing it.

I wrote this:

> Sometimes it&#8217;s when I&#8217;m right in the middle of it all that I feel the most outside of it all. When I&#8217;m safely at home, doing my own thing, I can say that all those people out there, those heaving throngs of regular people, the ones hanging out in the bars or the clubs, or dancing, they don&#8217;t matter to me. I don&#8217;t like dancing, it&#8217;s just not my bag.
> 
> But when I&#8217;m right in there, pressed up close to the leather-wearing cool-mongers wearing their shades in the crypt-like lighting &#8211; those shiny people that I know I&#8217;ve seen in some movie – that&#8217;s when I know it&#8217;s all a lie. I don&#8217;t like dancing because I can&#8217;t dance, because I can never step outside of my own self-consciousness for even a moment of carefree belonging. I don&#8217;t hang out because I don&#8217;t know how. I don&#8217;t go out because I don&#8217;t know where to go.

I got some good feedback:

J: Try to get rid of the first line. I can see how you needed it to get started, but it reveals too much too soon. (kinda like a thesis statement) Likes the last few – short, to the point. A little defensive, a little attitude.

N: honest. Wants to hear the story that&#8217;s about to begin.

S: Felt the attitude, wish he&#8217;d let the song take him there.

N: liked the cool-language reversed. couldn&#8217;t tell where it was going – home, or the club/bar. Would want to hear more.

I: liked the sense of alienation – no one else knows you&#8217;re out of it, but you know.

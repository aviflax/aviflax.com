The office of [Nita Lowey](https://lowey.house.gov/), my representative in the House of
Representatives of the United States Congress, recently asked me to answer [a survey on the
beleaguered Affordable Care Act](https://lowey.house.gov/AffordableCareActSurvey).

The survey included this question:

> What improvements to the health care system are most important to you?

These options were presented for an answer:

* Better cost control for premiums  
* Lower deductibles  
* Controlling prescription drug costs  
* Increase in number of affordable plans/options
* Tax-credit/government subsidy to help pay premiums
* Increasing Medicaid coverage
* No opinion

But the form only allowed me to choose one answer. So instead of choosing just one of those options,
I wrote an answer in the “other” box:

> All of the above. I want us to work towards universal healthcare, but it doesn’t need to be
single-payer or purely public. A hybrid public/private model such as that in place in Israel might
work well in the USA. New York could be a trailblazer on this, acting with courage and setting an
example for the entire country.

At the time I was wrote that (10 minutes ago) I didn’t know that:

> In 1995, Israel became the second-to-last country of the developed world to provide health care
insurance coverage to all of its citizens, leaving the U.S. as the only holdout.

…from [An Overview of Israel's Universal Health Care
System](http://ldi.upenn.edu/news/overview-israels-universal-health-care-system), published with no
byline by [The Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics at the University of
Pennsylvania](http://ldi.upenn.edu).

That seems perhaps a bit reductive, though, as according to [the relevant Wikipedia
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Israel):

> Israel has maintained a system of socialized health care since its establishment in 1948, although
the National Health Insurance law was passed only on 1 January 1995.

Model](https://physiciansnews.com/2009/10/01/can-universal-healthcare-work-a-look-at-israels-successful-model/).

As can be seen on [my resum√©](http://resume.aviflax.com/), PCC Internet Design was my first business. I started it in the spring of 1998 after my single semester of college proved &#8220;not for me.&#8221; I had a few jobs and a few clients, but nothing big. Its real significance proved to be securing me my first web development job, with a Georgetown web firm ([Ideal Computer Strategies](http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.icstrategies.com/), which is still around, albeit with a [different name](http://www.doceus.com/) and a different neighborhood). That job was where I did my first real professional programming and database design, and it really got me started.

I was just thinking this morning how cool it would be if I had some screenshots of the old site, what it used to look like back in 1998,1999. Then it occurred to me to check [The Internet Archive](http://web.archive.org/) &#8211; and [it&#8217;s there!](http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.pccdesign.com/) How cool! The graphics are missing, but you can get an idea. The archive seems to have started tracking the site in November 1998, after Ideal linked to it. Too bad the really early versions aren&#8217;t there, but hey this is still excellent.

I think that&#8217;s it, basically. Any questions?

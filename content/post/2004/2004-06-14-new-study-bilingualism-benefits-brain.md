A study in the June issue of [Psychology and Aging](http://www.apa.org/journals/pag.html) seems to indicate that fluent bilingualism can help a person put off dementia and stay alert longer. This is interesting to me because my grandmother suffers from [Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease) and because Elina and I both hope to be bilingual (with Hebrew) soon.

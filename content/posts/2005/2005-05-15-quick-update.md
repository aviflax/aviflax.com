Sorry to have been out of touch for so long! We&#8217;re crazy super busy wrapping up our time here and preparing for the next stage in the Flax adventure. Here&#8217;s a bunch of non-ordered chaotic factoids:

  * Last Wednesday was יו? הזכרון (memorial day) here and Thursday was יו? העצמות (independence day) &#8211; we stayed in Jerusalem and had a very meaningful valuable experience and a lot of fun too. We&#8217;re very glad we were here for this.
  * We spent this past Shabbat with our friend Mickey and his parents (and some other friends) in their beautiful home in the beautiful town of Zikhron Yaakov. Wonderful Shabbat!
  * We both finish our current educational endeavors on May 31
  * We&#8217;re returning to the States on June 14
  * We&#8217;re working on a _ton_ of projects right now:
  1. [Moving Sale](http://flaxfamily.com/forsale/jerusalem/)
  2. Looking for someone to take over our apartment (so as to not lose the last month&#8217;s rent)
  3. Trying to sell our house in Baltimore
  4. Looking for an apartment in Park Slope, Brooklyn
  5. Looking for jobs in NYC
  6. Elina&#8217;s working on a couple of Papers
  7. Avi&#8217;s writing college application essays
  8. Avi&#8217;s working on a presentation for _Humash_ (Pentatauch) class with my _Havruta_ (study partner) Leah.
  9. Avi&#8217;s preparing for a reading with his creative writing workshop on May 25
 10. Tons more crap that I can&#8217;t even dredge up at the moment.

Excuse me while I go weep.

Have a great day everybody! (And please don&#8217;t be mad if you don&#8217;t hear from us for a few weeks.)

I was checking [miata.net](http://miata.net/) for driving impressions of the new Miata (which is starting to arrive at area dealerships now, I really want to go check one out) and saw a link to [Mazda Zoom Zoom Live](https://www.zoomzoomlive.com/), a touring drive-our-cars event that lets anyone race brand new Miatas and 6es in various formats. Nice! They&#8217;ve got a complete schedule on the site &#8211; I might hit one of the November events in DC or Englishtown.

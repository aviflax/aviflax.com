[Imagine A Voice Powered Mobile Phoneâ€¦](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008628.html)

Great writeup by Russell Beattie really fleshes out an idea I&#8217;ve had for a while now&#8230; not that it&#8217;s a unique or new idea, it&#8217;s just been on my mind. This writeup points out that we could really do it right now.

I wonder if an independent developer could do it &#8211; the hardware would be the problem. Well, that could easily be bypassed by simply having users utilize a conventional phone + a bluetooth headset &#8211; and they could just leave the phone in their bag and never look at it. Once there was enough demand, the dedicated hardware would be created. I&#8217;m sure Nokia or Sony could do it without too much trouble &#8211; although Toshiba&#8217;s new fuel cell batteries would be very useful here. Hey, A fuel cell behind your ear, how cool would that be?!

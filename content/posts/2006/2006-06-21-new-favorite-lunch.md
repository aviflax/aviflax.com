I just had an excellent sandwich called a סביח (Sabich) at [Grill 44](http://menupages.com/restaurantDetails.asp?areaId=8&restaurantId=6090), a new Israeli restaurant right near my office. The sandwich was excellent, and, so far, so is everything else there! Jackie, the owner, is an actual Israeli, and very friendly. The food is tasty, well-prepared and presented, and reasonably priced. Great <span class="Plain">שקשוקה</span>!

The סביח [seems](http://newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/food/reviews/underground/12463/) to be an [up and coming](http://www.chickpearestaurant.com/contest.html) new food. I found this photo:

Mine looked better, though.

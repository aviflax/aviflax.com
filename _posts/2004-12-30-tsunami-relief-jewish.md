For US residents:

  * The [American Jewish World Service](http://www.ajws.org/index.cfm) has an [Emergency Appeal for Tsunami Relief](http://www.ajws.org/index.cfm?section_id=15). They take credit card donations by phone at 800-889-7146 or [online](https://secure3.ctsg.com/AJWS/donation/index.asp?Item=167), and checks by mail.
  * The [American Jewish Joint Distribution Comittee](https://www.jdc.org/) is accepting credit card donations by phone at 212-687-6200 or [online](https://www.jdc.org/donation/jdc_form.cfm), and [checks by mail](http://www.jdc.org/news_press_122904.html). Make sure you indicate &#8220;South Asia Tsunami Relief.&#8221; [Press release](http://www.jdc.org/news_press_122904.html).

I don&#8217;t know which Canadian, Israeli, or British organizations are working on this; if you do please tell me in a comment or email.

We don&#8217;t endorse any of these organizations per se, but this is an urgent situation and we don&#8217;t have time to play &#8220;choose the best charity organization.&#8221;

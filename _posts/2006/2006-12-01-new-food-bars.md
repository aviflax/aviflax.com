Elina and I like food bars &#8211; they&#8217;re very convenient for substantial and healthy snacks between meals. We started with [Odwalla bars](http://www.odwalla.com/product1.asp?p=nourishingbars&sw=1), then [LaraBars](https://www.larabar.com/). Today, at local fancy-shmancy gourmet grocery Divine Taste, we found a new favorite: the [Gnu Foods flavor & fiber](http://www.gnufoods.com/) bar. We tried the [Banana Walnut Bar](http://www.gnufoods.com/ourproducts/bananawalnut.cfm) &#8211; and we found it pleasing: tasty, moist, chewey, and natural-tasting, if a bit sweet. Still, their nutritional profile seems amazingly good: moderate calories, decent protein, low fat, no trans fat, low sugars. Very impressive, especially compared to other bars.

Gnu&#8217;s website is excellent and includes a well-integrated shop &#8211; this is part of a very positive trend of small manufacturers selling their goods directly to individuals in addition to distributors and retailers. And they offer an innovative and convenient way to keep their bars in stock with their [Joy of Fiber](http://www.gnufoods.com/shop/joyoffiber.cfm) program.

Another recent discovery is the [CLIF Nectar bar](http://www.clifbar.com/eat/eat.cfm?location=nectar), an organic and natural alternative to their not-so-natural other foods. Tastes good, but a little expensive at $1.75 per bar, before tax and shipping.

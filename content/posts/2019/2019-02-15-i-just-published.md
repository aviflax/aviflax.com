I just published an update to [the website](https://fundingcircle.github.io/fc4-framework/) for the software architecture diagramming framework I’m working on, featuring an improved definition:

> FC4 is a [_Docs as Code_](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/) framework that enables software creators to author, publish, and maintain software architecture diagrams more effectively, efficiently, and collaboratively over time.

It’s quite a mouthful, I know, but I’m feeling good about it. It feels clear, comprehensive, and usefully specific.

Any and all feedback, suggestions, questions, etc would be welcome!

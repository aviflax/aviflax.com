Well, after a somewhat down time, things are on the upswing right now:

  * Our new air conditioner has been installed &#8211; contact me if you need a good HVAC contractor &#8211; it&#8217;s good to be home!
  * Finally posted both our [S2000](http://s2k.aviflax.com/) and our [Accord](http://baltimore.craigslist.org/car/34251282.html) up for sale. We&#8217;ve had healthy interest in both, which is great &#8211; it appears that they will sell soon. We hope so!
  * We are making good progress finding a tenant to rent our house &#8211; I don&#8217;t want to say any more quite yet.
  * Elina was able to get off the crutches after only two days and her foot is much better.
  * I&#8217;m almost done with a [
  
    project](http://goodtimepatrol.org/) that I had been putting off.
  * We had a good father&#8217;s day yesterday &#8211; Elina&#8217;s pop was happy with his gifts, and we had a nice talk with her Grampa in Paris.

&#8230; and that&#8217;s enough for now, don&#8217;t want to tempt fate!

Thanks to everyone for putting up with my whining!

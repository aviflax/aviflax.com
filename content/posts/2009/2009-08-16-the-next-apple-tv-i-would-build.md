title: The Next Apple TV I Would Build

Reading [this rumor](http://www.loopinsight.com/2009/08/10/new-apple-tv-to-be-a-mac-mini-with-blu-ray/) about the next Apple TV including Blu-Ray got me thinking about what I&#8217;d add to the next-generation Apple TV to make it great.

I&#8217;d love to see it have:

  * A Blu-Ray/DVD/CD drive
  * A TV tuner and DVR functionality
  * Safari — now that the [iPhone Remote app](http://www.apple.com/itunes/remote/) can display a keyboard for the Apple TV&#8217;s text interfaces, and could easily support pointer control, there&#8217;s no real impediment to a full-blown web browser — preferably including Flash, so sites like Hulu and Vimeo would function
  * An app store — why not? The Apple TV is really just a computer with TV-optimized ports, drivers, and UI. (Similar to how the iPhone is really just a computer with mobile-optimized hardware and software.) Once the iPhone Remote app enabled a keyboard and pointer anywhere, it&#8217;d be pretty great to be able to browse and install third-party apps, just as on the iPhone. Apple already has the infrastructure for this; releasing an Apple TV SDK would be no sweat.
  * Dashboard widget support. TVs and widgets will go together as naturally as peanut butter and jelly.
  * An easy way to copy music and video to the device without _having_ to use iTunes
  * Broader media format support — it should support divx, mkv, vorbis, theora, flac, etc.
  * The ability to plug in a memory card — preferably to the built-in SD-card reader — and display a slide show of the photos and videos on the card, or copy them to the ATV
  * User-upgradeable hard drive. Don&#8217;t get me started on this.
  * A true sleep mode which uses nearly zero energy
  * The ability to display the photos and videos on my phone, via wifi, without copying them first

I see all these things as easily attainable. I&#8217;d buy it!

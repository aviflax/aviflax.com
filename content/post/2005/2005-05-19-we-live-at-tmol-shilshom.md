Last night we were privileged to be at one of our favorite caf√©s, [Tmol Shilshom](http://www.tmol-shilshom.co.il/) for a reading and talk by our friend [Ilene](http://www.google.com/search?num=50&hl=en&lr=&safe=off&c2coff=1&q=%22ilene+prusher%22&btnG=Search) about her experiences reporting in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the greater middle east over the past 5 years. She also read part of her upcoming novel based on those experiences. It&#8217;s really nice to be friends with someone so articulate, talented, and professional and also warm, friendly and caring. 

Ilene leads the Pardes Writing Workshop, which is having a reading at Tmol Shilshom (see the [schedule](http://www.tmol-shilshom.co.il/events.html)) next Wednesday, the 25th of May. So if anyone that reads this lives in Jerusalem, come on out and hear Avi read some of his ramblings!

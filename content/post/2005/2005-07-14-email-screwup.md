While working on moving our website and email to [our new host](http://www.textdrive.com/) I of course screwed up the email settings for our domains for at least a few hours. Fixed now. If you tried to send us mail in the past few hours, you should have received an error message letting you know it didn&#8217;t work, but I&#8217;m posting this just in case. If you did try to send a message, you can resend it now.

Sorry &#8217;bout that.

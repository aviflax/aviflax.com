This post is about [Camino](http://www.caminobrowser.org/). But first:

For many Mac users, the question of which web browser to use is pretty much a showdown between Apple&#8217;s [Safari]() and Mozilla&#8217;s Firefox. I&#8217;m not a typical Mac user, however, so I use those two browsers, plus one other, in different contexts:

  * Personal browsing: Safari. It&#8217;s fast, attractive, well integrated into OS X, and renders most sites well
  * Web development: Firefox. [Firebug](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843), [Web Developer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60), and [Live HTTP Headers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3829) make Firefox the only browser to use in this context
  * Work browsing: Camino. All the compatiblity of Firefox, all the speed and integration of Safari. Just right.

&#8230;and the truth is, I frequently fire up Safari at work or Camino at home, depending on the activity and sites I&#8217;m browsing.

That said, Camino&#8217;s new release, version 1.5, is really, really excellent. It launches super-fast, is rock-solid, has superb compatibility and integration, and wonderful features. If I had to choose just one browser, this would be it.

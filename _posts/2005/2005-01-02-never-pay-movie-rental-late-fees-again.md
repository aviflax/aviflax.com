It just occurred to me that I should share this tip with the world. Here you go:

1) If you live in the USA, use [Netflix](http://netflix.com). Fast DVD rentals, with no due date at all! No more travel to a video store, no more agonizing over which movie to rent! With Netflix you keep a list of all the movies you want to see, and when you return one they automatically send you the next one &#8211; you _always_ have movies at home to choose from. They&#8217;ve got a huge selection too. 

> Bonus: if you have a Mac, [Netflix Freak](http://www.thelittleappfactory.com/application.php?app=Netflix%20Freak) is a great way to manage your Netflix queue.

2) If you have a Mac, use [MacTheRipper](http://www.wormintheapple.gr/macdvd/mtr.html) and/or [HandBrake](http://handbrake.m0k.org/) to rip DVDs to your computer to watch them at a later time &#8211; you can return a rented DVD on Monday and watch it on Wednesday &#8211; poof, no late fees!

> The MacTheRipper page has a bad download link &#8211; [good link here](http://homepage.mac.com/wiseweasel/mactheripper26.dmg.bz2).

> MacTheRipper will copy the DVD to your computer exactly as it is on the disk &#8211; menus, extras, and all. But &#8211; it&#8217;ll be huge, using from 4-9 Gigabytes of your computer&#8217;s hard disk (AKA &#8220;hard drive&#8221;). That&#8217;s where HandBrake comes in. It will also rip a DVD to your disk, but it will also compress it on the fly, so a 5-6GB movie can become a 1-2GB file. Lets you fit many more movies on the computer. It can rip straight from a disk or even from a disk that you ripped to your computer with MacTheRipper already. Caution: the current version can&#8217;t handle subtitles &#8211; but the next version, due in a few months, should be able to. It can take a few hours too. Worth it, though.

> Bonus: if you&#8217;re on a long trip, watching movies off your computers hard disk can help your battery stretch an extra hour or two, letting you watch a longer film or maybe even an extra one. The DVD drive uses a lot more battery power than the hard disk drive. If you travel often, check out the [iGo Juice 70](http://www.mobilityelectronics.com/power/juice/) &#8211; it&#8217;s a universal laptop charger that works with any power outlet in the world &#8211; and in cars and planes! We just got one and we like it.

3) _Caution: Geeks Only!_ If you don&#8217;t have a Mac, but do have a x86 system and are comfortable with Debian or Unix/Linux, then you can use [HandBrake](http://handbrake.m0k.org/) too &#8211; Debian package [here](http://twolife.org/debian/repository.php), or [download the source](http://handbrake.m0k.org/download.php).

> Geek idea: howabout a Knoppix or Morphix build designed to help Windows users run HandBrake &#8211; it would need NTFS capability so it can rip the movies directly to the users Windows partitions.

4) If you don&#8217;t live in the US, and don&#8217;t use a Mac, and aren&#8217;t comfortable with Debian or Unix/Linux, then [Switch To The Mac](http://the.taoofmac.com/space/HOWTO/Switch%20To%20The%20Mac).

5) If you can&#8217;t/won&#8217;t switch, then check out [How To Survive In Windows](http://the.taoofmac.com/space/HOWTO/Survive%20In%20Windows)

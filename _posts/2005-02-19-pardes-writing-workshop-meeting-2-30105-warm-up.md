Ilene started this meeting off with a few quotes. I only recorded one:
  
&#8220;If only I could think maybe I wouldn&#8217;t have to write.&#8221; &#8211; Scott Spenser.

Our warm-up started with word association with words from the Torah portion of the week, Parshat Mishpatim, Exodus. Ilene would say a word, and we&#8217;d write whatever came to mine. Here&#8217;s mine:

  * **Witness** &#8211; male, elite, testify, memory, forget
  * **Restitution** &#8211; revenge, compensation, too little too late, empty
  * **Strangers** &#8211; not-us, woman, other, suspect

Ilene then asked us to do something with our words. I wrote this:

> The male elite of the ages made testimony something only people could do, and only males were fully people. Woman was made the other &#8211; their memories were suspect, their testimony unreliable. Today those I challenge to admit the wrongness in this throw out empty phrases &#8211; and they join the throngs in their wrongness.

Finally stumbled across a website that lists movie release dates for Israel, and has the movies listed in English so I can find them! It&#8217;s [seret.co.il](http://seret.co.il/) &#8211; &#8220;seret&#8221; is Hebrew for film.

So here are the movies that I hope Elina and I will catch when they are released here:

The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy &#8211; May 5
  
(May 5 is Yom Hazikaron &#8211; Memorial Day here, so probably won&#8217;t see it that day)

Star Wars: Episode III &#8211; Revenge of the Sith &#8211; May 19

hmm, I guess that&#8217;s it. Well, I&#8217;m still glad to finally know the release dates!

Earlier this month I submitted [a talk proposal to the Kafka
Summit](http://tech.parkassist.com/blog/2017/01/04/kafka-summit-proposal). I posted the proposal to
the inchoate [Park Assist tech blog](http://tech.parkassist.com/blog/), but one part I left out was
a paragraph on my professional background. I think I left it out because for some reason I wrote it
for a very specific audience; when I contemplated posting it publicly in such a dignified context as
the Park Assist tech blog I was nervous that it would seem pretentious.

Since no one reads this site, though, it should be safe for me to post this here:

> Web developer since 1998. Software architect since 2006. Data architect since 2016. Early adopter.
> Currently excited about stream data and “serverless” (FaaS) and thinking about how to best combine
> the two. Starting to think I might actually understand what CQRS is. Programming systems: current:
> Ruby; favorite: Clojure; tracking: Eve.

Pretentious enough?

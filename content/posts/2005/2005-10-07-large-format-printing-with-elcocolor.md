Alex King [points](http://www.alexking.org/blog/2005/10/06/fall/) to [a blog entry](http://www.tow.com/2005/10/06/large-format-printing/) by [Adam Tow](http://www.tow.com/) which discusses ordering large prints over the internet from ElcoColor. Interesting! Good info.

One thing I personally could use a little more detail on is his mention of the &#8220;color profile conversion legwork to ensure that your print looks good&#8230;&#8221; &#8211; I&#8217;m a neophyte at this, so I&#8217;m not sure if he&#8217;s talking about embedding a color profile into a JPEG file, or simply adjusting the color values in a standard JPEG using their profile. If he feels like providing a bit more detail on the process I&#8217;d be highly appreciative!

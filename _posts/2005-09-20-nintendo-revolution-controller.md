[This Video](http://video.dagbladet.no/pub/artikkel/4/44/443/443527/popup.html) (shrink your browser window to watch) that [Russel Beattie](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008626.html) linked to shows the new controller for the Nintendo Revolution in action. It&#8217;s really, well, revolutionary! It allows movement and interaction in 3D space. In plain language, that means that the games can be aware of how you move the controller in your hand. So you can move it as if it&#8217;s a sword, a baseball bat, a fishing rod, a pool cue, etc, etc, and the game will react accordingly. If you&#8217;re at all interested, watch the video. It&#8217;s exciting!

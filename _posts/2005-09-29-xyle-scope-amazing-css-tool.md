The ever-helpful [Rui Carmo](http://the.taoofmac.com/), via [Ben Jackson](http://www.incomumdesign.com/ "Ben Jackson"), pointed me to a new(ish) OS X app called [Xyle Scope](http://www.culturedcode.com/xyle/index.html "Xyle Scope"), an amazing CSS viewer, editor, visualizer, and debugger. It&#8217;s very impressive, seems completely useful and useable, and is only $15! I&#8217;ll definitely pick up a copy at some point soon.

_(BTW I am totally jealous of Rui&#8217;s wikiblog/bliki/whatever. It&#8217;s very sweet. I hope he gets to his planned rewrite soon so he can finally release the code! It&#8217;s even cited by [WikiPedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bliki) as an example of the genre.)_

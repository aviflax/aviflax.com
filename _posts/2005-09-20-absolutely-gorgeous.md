A [post](http://www.autoblog.com/entry/1234000777058893/) at Autoblog showed me first photos of the production version of the Alfa Romeo Brera, the concept that made me drool back in 2002. The production version, unveiled at the Frankfurt show, is remarkably and wonderfully close to the concept. Bravo Alfa! And while the production car doesn&#8217;t have the sick V8 from the concept, I think the 260-hp 3.2-liter V6 is quite appropriate.

Just sent this message to a friend and then figured I may as well share it with the world &#8211; anyone looking for a job should use it (unless you&#8217;re looking for tech jobs in NYC. then don&#8217;t bother. it sucks.)

> Hi Dominique! I was just schmoozing with Sima & Mike and Elina here and I mentioned to them [Indeed.com](http://www.indeed.com "Indeed - one search. all jobs.") &#8211; and then it occurred to me that you&#8217;d probably want to know about it! Indeed is one of the new breed of small, super-focused search sites nipping at Google&#8217;s heels. It&#8217;s basically a meta-search engine for the job market &#8211; one search at Indeed lets you search every single job site all at once &#8211; monster, hotjobs, careerbuilder, wsj, craigslist, everything. all. at. once. and &#8211; you can subscribe to any search via email or RSS.

Two weeks ago I spoke at [the Bay Area Clojure User Group SF Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/The-Bay-Area-Clojure-User-Group/events/246140016/) (hosted by my employer, [Funding Circle](https://fundingcircle.com/)).

At the time I called the talk _Large nested JSON with spec, a comedy of errors_ but next time I give it I think Iâ€™ll call it something like _Specifying Other Peopleâ€™s Data with Spec: an Experience Report_.

Despite a few errors in the slides and a few minor technical problems the talk went fairly well. I had pretty good engagement from the attendees and quite positive feedback afterwards.

And now thanks to some of my excellent co-workers, [a video of the talk](https://youtu.be/5JpcDKooaIQ) has been posted!

Hereâ€™s a still frame from the video:

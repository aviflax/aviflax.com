[Amazon&#8217;s](http://www.amazon.com/) new [Grocery](http://www.amazon.com/b/102-2303743-6523309?node=16310101) department, which sells a wide selection of non-perishable food and household items, can be an affordable and convenient way to shop for certain types of groceries. They tend to sell items in packs and cases &#8212; not quite bulk, to my mind, but kind of in-between for people who like that sort of thing &#8212; like me.

I just ordered two items:

  * **[Crown Prince Natural Solid White Albacore Tuna in Water, No Salt Added, 6.125-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000EF18ZC/102-2303743-6523309?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance)**
  * **[Larabar Bars, Chocolate Coconut Chew, 16 &#8211; 1.8 oz (51 g) bars [28.8 oz (816 g)]](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000EO0XAE/102-2303743-6523309?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance)**

As you can see, it&#8217;s 24 6.123oz cans of tuna, and 16 food bars. For those items, these quantities seem just right.

The prices are reasonable to start with, but there are a few things that make Amazon groceries a great deal:

  * No taxes are charged
  * Free standard shipping of orders $25 or higher, or unlimited 2-day shipping for $79 a year with [Amazon Prime](http://www.amazon.com/gp/subs/primeclub/signup/main.html)
  * Coupon code **GROCERY2** takes $10 off any order with at least $49 worth of Grocery items 
  * using [A9.com](http://a9.com) for websearching activates a 1.57% discount 

My order should be shipped out tomorrow (Monday) and we should receive it on Tuesday or Wednesday. I&#8217;ll try to follow-up on how that goes.

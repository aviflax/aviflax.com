UK friends! Iâ€™ll be speaking at [the 7 March London Clojurians meetup at Funding Circle](https://www.meetup.com/London-Clojurians/events/258992631/)! My talk _Growing a Clojure CLI Tool_ will be a case study in building and growing a usable CLI tool (one that runs tolerably on the JVM ðŸ˜…). I hope to see you there!

We&#8217;re back in Baltimore for the weekend, having spent the first half of the week up in NYC. Drove up there Sunday morning, Avi had a job interview around noon. Spent a few days looking for apartments, we may have found the right one. Now we&#8217;re back in Baltimore, so if you want to hang out this weekend, call!

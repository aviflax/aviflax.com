I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on, but my personal email account has been hammered by spam today &#8211; over 1956 mails in the last 24 hours. Normally I wouldn&#8217;t even notice, since Gmail&#8217;s spam filtering is truly excellent. But with that kind of volume it&#8217;s not surprising that a few spams slipped through. I have noticed that many of them are of the type that spoof messages from &#8220;postmaster&#8221; or &#8220;mail delivery subsystem&#8221;, with subjects like &#8220;Undelivered Mail Returned to Sender&#8221;. Another thing I&#8217;ve noticed is that many of the spams aren&#8217;t addressed to any of my actual addresses, but rather to seemingly random addresses at my domains. So I&#8217;m considering turning off my wildcard forwarding, at least temporarily.

**update:** Now up to at least 2,500 spams within 24 hours. wow.

**update:** Tuesday, 19:52: about 8,500 spams in the past 48 hours. Gmail&#8217;s spam filtering is doing a decent job, I&#8217;d say only a small percentage of this onslaught is making it to my inbox.

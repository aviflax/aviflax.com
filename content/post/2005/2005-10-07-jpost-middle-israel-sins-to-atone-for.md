[Middle Israel: Sins to atone for](http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&cid=1128219507580&apage=2) is an interesting piece from [Amotz Asa-El](mailto:amotz@jpost.com) that purports to be statements from Israel&#8217;s most prominent political figures on their biggest regrets from their political careers. If they&#8217;re real, they&#8217;re really interesting. If not, they&#8217;re still interesting, but less significant.

> I’ve been quite satisfied with your apps for many years now. I’ve seen fairly steady incremental improvements over time with only a few missteps. Currently, there’s one thing that’s bugging me about both your iOS apps and your Web app: all the marketing. It gets in my way and it bothers me. I’m already your customer, and I use these apps; they are *tools*. Please cut back on all the marketing in the apps. It will make them better, more usable tools.

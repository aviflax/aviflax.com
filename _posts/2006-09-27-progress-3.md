Our house is [sold](http://flaxfamily.com/post/house-is-sold/), and I just ordered a bike, a [Bianchi Axis](http://bianchiusa.com/07_axis.html)!

MSRP on this bike is $1400, but fortunately my co-worker Mike sent me to _his_ friend Mike, the owner of [Bicycle Station](http://newyork.citysearch.com/profile/7394134/), which is in Prospect Heights, about a 20 minute walk from our apartment. He&#8217;s hooking me up with a great deal!

I should be taking delivery next Wednesday or Thursday, and I&#8217;m _really_ looking forward to it!

  My dearest Elina,
</p>

<p style="font-family: Baskerville; font-style: italic; font-size: 20pt;">
  Tonight, as our third anniversary begins, I wish I could fully express the gratitude and joy that I feel as we mark this milestone in our life together – but I couldn&#8217;t possibly hope to do so with any true efficacy. My love for you can&#8217;t be quantified, assessed, reckoned, or transmitted by mere language.
</p>

<p style="font-family: Baskerville; font-style: italic; font-size: 20pt;">
  Elina, I can only tell you that I love you now and forever, and I am truly thankful to have you as my partner for the rest of my life. I hope that I can one day make you half as happy as you have made me.
</p>

<p style="font-family: Baskerville; font-style: italic; font-size: 20pt;">
  I love you forever.<br />Avi

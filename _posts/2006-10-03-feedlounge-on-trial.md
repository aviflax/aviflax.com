I&#8217;ve been a big fan of [FeedLounge](http://feedlounge.com/) &#8211; and a paying customer &#8211; for a good while now (6 months?). But over the past month or two I&#8217;ve noticed my usage declining. I think there were a few reasons for that: (1) I had too many feeds, and couldn&#8217;t keep up with them; (2) the way I was using FL was making it hard to get through that backlog.

So, I was stuck.

And then, last week, [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/) released a [major update](http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2006/09/something-looks-different.html) which finally made it a serious FL competitor, for me. It&#8217;s good &#8211; real good.

Most of changes and new features in GReader are basically catch-up, bringing them up to par with FL. I think the single most compelling new feature, and the one which make GR a candidate to replace FL for me, is the automatic-marking-as-read while browsing. With FL, the way I&#8217;ve been using it, I need to click on an item to mark it as read. Or manually mark a page of items or a feed of items as read. With GR, all I have to do is&#8230; read. The interface automatically notes when I read something (i.e., when I scroll to it) and marks it as read. This is _hot_. This kind of intelligence is long-overdue for software in general. It&#8217;s about time for software to observe how we use it and actively _do stuff_ to help us out.

So: an experiment. I ruthlessly marked all my feeds as &#8220;read&#8221;, deleted a few heavy-volume feeds, and imported my OPML list of feeds into Google Reader. I&#8217;m going to use GReader as my main reader for the next week, then switch back to FL for the following week. At that point I may or may not continue for another round or two. After 1-3 rounds, I&#8217;ll make my decision.

Will FL keep its crown &#8211; and my $5 a month? Let&#8217;s find out!

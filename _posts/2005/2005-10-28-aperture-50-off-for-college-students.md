Apple&#8217;s hot new pro photo workflow software [Aperture](http://www.apple.com/aperture/) is normally $500 &#8211; well worth it for professionals, but out of the league for many photography enthusiasts such as myself. So I was pleasantly surprised to see that Apple takes 50% off for anyone that qualifies for their [educational discount](http://store.apple.com/Catalog/US/Images/routingpage.html) (all teachers, and college students, but unfortunately grade school students don&#8217;t qualify). $250 is still quite a bit of money, but it&#8217;s 50% more attainable for the enthusiast student. Nice!

This reminds me that Apple also has a great educational price for [Final Cut Studio](http://www.apple.com/finalcutstudio/) &#8211; which includes the full versions of Final Cut Pro 5, Soundtrack Pro, Motion 2 and DVD Studio Pro 4 &#8211; it&#8217;s $700 instead of $1,300.

It&#8217;s all academic (heh, heh, sorry) for me anyway; budget constrains mean that my next &#8220;creative&#8221; software purchase will probably be [Final Cut Express](http://www.apple.com/finalcutexpress/) &#8211; for $150 instead of $300 &#8211; I&#8217;m ready to move up from [iMovie](http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/)

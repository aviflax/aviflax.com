My co-worker Rama told me a few weeks ago that after switching his home LAN from a Linksys WRT-54G wireless router to the [Apple Airport Extreme](http://www.apple.com/airportextreme/), regular web browsing sped up dramatically. I was surprised, and hopeful but skeptical that I&#8217;d see the same thing.

Well, I just swapped my routers last night, and I&#8217;m pleased to report the same end result as Rama. Web browsing, and all HTTP transfers, are significantly faster. Big bonus!

So if you have a WRT-54G running your home LAN, and you&#8217;d like to speed up your connection without switching to some premium service like FIOS or something, if you&#8217;re even eligible, try getting rid of your WRT-54G. I&#8217;m not going to say that the Airport Extreme is the only router that&#8217;s faster, because it probably isn&#8217;t, but I can say that it definitely _is_ one of the faster ones.

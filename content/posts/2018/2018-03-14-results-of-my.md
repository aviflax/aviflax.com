* _The Witch Boy_ by Molly Ostertag » ★★★★☆
* _Superman: American Alien_ by Max Landis » ★★★★☆
* _Artemis_ by Andy Weir » ★★☆☆☆

I didn’t finish Artemis. I only got about ¼ through and gave up — I just wasn’t enjoying it. It was disappointing after how riveting _The Martian_ was, but the story didn’t grab me and the writing felt rote and uninspired.

I just posted [this message](http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Maps-Troubleshooting/browse_thread/thread/2feb73f7d3b94c4b) to the [Google Maps Help Group](http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Maps):

    GooMaps told me to take the B train today, but it&#8217;s not running today,<br /> due to Thanksgiving! If I&#8217;m going to trust Google&#8217;s transit<br /> directions, it needs to account for all the complexities of the<br /> transit system schedule, including holidays!

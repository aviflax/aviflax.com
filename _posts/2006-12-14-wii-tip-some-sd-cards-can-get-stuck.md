Just a tip for Google to index: the Sandisk Ultra II SD+ (Plus) cards can get stuck in it&#8217;s SD slot. I had trouble removing mine, to the point where I removed the SD compartment door, then used a tiny screwdriver to tease the card out of its slot. I&#8217;m uncertain now whether the slot is spring-loaded or not. Either way, just be careful, and if you can&#8217;t remove your SD card from your Wii, be patient and you&#8217;ll get it out eventually.

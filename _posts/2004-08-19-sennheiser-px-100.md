Picked these up yesterday. Amazing sound for the size and price! These headphones are comfortable, compact, and really sound wonderful. They make my iPod so much more enjoyable. Paid &#8362;350, just under double the best US price of about $42. That&#8217;s about normal. Well worth it! Highly recommended!

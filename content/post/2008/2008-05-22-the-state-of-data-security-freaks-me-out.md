title: The State of Data Security Freaks Me Out

Just read [How Would You Prefer to Send Sensitive Data?](http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/05/21/2241204) over at Slashdot. It freaks me out that people are still asking questions like these in 2008, and that the answers aren&#8217;t clear, simple, and obvious &#8211; instead, there&#8217;s a complex, convoluted discussion. It&#8217;s amazing that there are still people who ask others to email their Social Security Numbers. I&#8217;m aghast that all email isn&#8217;t automatically encrypted by default (including my own).

Crazy.

Found a very cool [photo](http://www.emporis.com/en/il/im/?id=207621) of our building at [Emporis](http://www.emporis.com/) &#8211; but I can&#8217;t just display it here for legal reasons, so just click the link.

To explain: the three tallest buildings in the center are the leftmost buildings of Wolfson Towers. The two buildings to the right are the remainder of Wolfson. Just below the leftmost Wolfson building are three smaller towers &#8211; that&#8217;s Migdal Megiddo (Tower of [Megiddo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megiddo)) &#8211; and we&#8217;re in the center tower, 10th floor, just under the penthouse.

The trees in the foreground are in Gan Sacher (Sacher Park), the road is Sderot Ben-Tzvi. The tallish building in the distance directly above our building is the Sheraton hotel on Keren HaYesod.

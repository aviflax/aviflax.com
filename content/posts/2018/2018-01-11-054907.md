A friend introduced me yesterday to @frena_bakery, an Iraqi-Israeli Kosher Bakery in SoMa in San Francisco. I’ve been twice now, and everything is literally amazing. If I closed my eyes and took a bite, I could have been in Israel. The sabich is a triumph. I’m so excited to patronize this wonderful establishment on every future trip to SF!

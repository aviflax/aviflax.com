Iâ€™ve been loving the new Feminist Frequency (@FemFreq) podcast, and after finally seeing Black Panther (which is magnificent) last night, I listened to [the episode focused on the film](http://feministfrequency.com/video/feminist-frequency-radio-episode-14-black-panther/) this morning and I was greatly moved and informed by their reactions. Recommended!

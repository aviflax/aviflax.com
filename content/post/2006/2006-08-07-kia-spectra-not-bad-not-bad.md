For our current trip down to Baltimore for Reuben&#8217;s wedding, we rented a black 2006 Kia Spectra from Hertz with 1500 miles. The car&#8217;s not bad at all. The driving dynamics are better than I expected &#8211; not great, but not horrible either.

I didn&#8217;t know the price of this car, so I had no way to know whether it&#8217;s a decent value or not. So I decided to compare it to my current favorite small car, the Mazda 3.

I think the model I&#8217;m driving is a Spectra EX. OK, the total MSRP, including destination, is $15,275. That includes air conditioning, power everything, disc brakes without ABS, and a manual tranny.

A similar Mazda 3 seems to be the &#8220;i&#8221; model &#8211; A/C is an available option, it&#8217;s a manual tranny, and disc brakes without ABS. Total price with A/C: $15,150.

Wow. If those numbers are accurate, then I know which way I&#8217;d go &#8211; the 3 all the way. The handling, power, and buld quality are all a good step or two above the Kia. And ABS is available for only $395. Now that&#8217;s a good deal.

If you&#8217;re looking for a good car that&#8217;s practical, fun to drive, reliable, and affordable, I highly recommend the Mazda 3.

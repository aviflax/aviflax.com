[This article](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060716.wHaifa0716/BNStory/Front/) at The Globe and Mail &#8211; actually from the AP, so it&#8217;s probably one of hundreds or thousands of instances of it &#8211; has the headline &#8220;Israel unleashes fiercest assault in Beirut after Haifa attacked.&#8221; I posted this comment: 

> I&#8217;m concerned by this headline &#8211; it seems to reverse the order of events. It makes the Haifa attack seem almost a postscript &#8212; when in fact it was the event that forced Israel to retaliate. In fact, why was the Israeli response characterized as a &#8220;fierce assault&#8221; that was &#8220;unleashed&#8221; while the rockets fired at civilian targets in Haifa are just an &#8220;attack&#8221;? According to my dictionary, the word &#8220;assault&#8221; implies a greater degree of viciousness than the simple &#8220;attack&#8221;. I&#8217;d question the editorial stance that makes a rocket launch at civilian targets an &#8220;attack&#8221; and the military response an &#8220;assault&#8221;.

I didn&#8217;t want to actually suggest a headline; I thought it might make the editors somewhat indignant and dismissive of my point. But I did come up with what I think would be a more reasonable headline; something like: &#8220;Hezbolla Fires Rockets on Haifa; Israel Responds with Airstrikes&#8221;.

**Update:** As of 3:30PM EST today, the headline had already been changed, along with much of the article, to focus on the deaths of 8 Canadian citizens in Lebanon. The new headline is &#8220;Eight Canadians killed in airstrikes on Lebanon.&#8221; I&#8217;m glad the old biased headline was changed, but I&#8217;m confused by the changes. It doesn&#8217;t make sense to me for an article to evolve over the matter of a few hours, changing topics and content. If all articles and similar publications become that fluid, that will be severely problematic for accountability &#8212; not to mention an intelligible discourse. How can people have a conversation about a piece if everyone&#8217;s reading a different version?

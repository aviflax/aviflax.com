[Our](http://flaxfamily.com) iPhoto library hit 20,000 photos, 701 events, and 70 gigabytes on Sunday. This seems like a good time for a little introspection into what all these photos are. So I&#8217;ve put together some breakdowns.

      We started taking digital photos in November 2001. I&#8217;m combining these years because I don&#8217;t have accurate data, due to my using the unforgivably crappy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop_Album">Adobe Photoshop Album</a> as our first photo library. When I exported the photos from the library, their EXIF data was mangled somehow.

      In the summer of 2004 we put our belongings in storage, rented out our house, and moved to Jerusalem for a year. I think the big jump over the previous year is due to our getting our first pocket camera in December 2003, and due to taking more photos once in Israel.

      Replacement for our SD300 after I lost it or dropped it, can&#8217;t recall. I think we owned two of these, and in fact I broke both of them by dropping them at concerts. I believe the first concert was Matisyahu and the second was Blind Melon. Following the demise of our most recent SD600, we are once again needing another pocket camera (or two). Decision time, yay.

### By Lens

We have three lenses for our Nikon D80, so it&#8217;s interesting to compare.

    <td>
      Not surprising that this one came out on top. It&#8217;s fast, small, and light. It&#8217;s the only lens we bought used. The focal length, on our D80 with its APS-C sensor, ends up being equivalent to about 42mm – just slightly wide, and very useful.

      Useful when we need a zoom, but it&#8217;s big, bulky, and a little slow, so it&#8217;s not our default lens.
    </td>

      50mm
    </th>
    
    <td>

    </td>
    
    <td>
      The least used by far, even though it&#8217;s the sharpest. On our D80, with its APS-C sensor, this is roughly equivalent to an 80mm lens on a 35mm camera. That means it&#8217;s not very useful indoors, except for posed portraits – which we rarely shoot. Interestingly, this lens is one of the reasons that we bought the D80 specifically, as opposed to the D40; the D80 is compatible with these older lenses. It&#8217;s the only lens we had before we bought the D80; we had used it with our N65 35mm film camera, where the 50mm &#8220;standard&#8221; focal length was very useful.

### Backup

Our photo library&#8217;s total size is currently 69.61GB, and we&#8217;re backing it up to [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/). So according to their Pricing Calculator, we&#8217;re paying about $10 a month to back it all up. Hmm.

### Methodology

I gathered all the numbers manually using iPhoto&#8217;s &#8220;Smart Albums&#8221; feature. For example, to figure out how many photos we took in 2006, I created a Smart Album with a criteria for the date to be between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2006. I&#8217;m not sure if this is 100% accurate but it&#8217;s close enough for my purposes. For every Smart Album I created, I also added the criteria &#8220;Photo is not Movie&#8221; to exclude movies.

For more accurate, comprehensive, and automated analysis, I was thinking of using [Metadata Export for iPhoto](http://www.tc.umn.edu/~erick205/Projects/Metadata%20Export/) to export metadata about every single photo in my library to CSV, then writing a Python script to gather all sorts of statistics about the photos using EXIF data. Unfortunately I didn&#8217;t have a chance; maybe next time.

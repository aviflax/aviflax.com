I love writing for the World Wide Web, and good writing for the Web is rich with hyperlinks. So when I write for that medium I’m always on the lookout for a term or idea that’d make a good link.

But!

I need to stay focused on my words. I can’t risk looking for a good URL in the moment.

So I insert (LINK) just after the term or concept, and add it later during editing.

This has been working very well for me lately.

TIL that in 1971 [Flo Kennedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florynce_Kennedy):

> …founded the [US] Feminist Party, which nominated [Shirley Chisholm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Chisholm) for president.

…I’d just been wistfully wishing there was a viable, robust, intersectional US party called the Feminist Party… I’d join up in a heartbeat.

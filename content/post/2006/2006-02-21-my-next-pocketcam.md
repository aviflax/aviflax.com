Not much time right now (have some work to do) but:

  * [Luminous landscape &#8211; DMD &#8211; decisive moment digital](http://www.luminous-landscape.com/columns/DMD.shtml)
  
    Outlines a vision for a high-quality compact digital camera, an ideal companion to a DSLR. I like!
  * The [Panasonic Lumix DMC-FX01](http://www.dpreview.com/news/0602/06021404panasonicfx01.asp) is an ultra-compact camera with a 28mm Leica lens and optical image stabilization! It&#8217;s exciting but Panasonic&#8217;s recent cameras have had noise problems.
  * Announced today: the [Canon PowerShot SD700 IS Digital ELPH](http://www.dpreview.com/news/0602/06022110canonsd700is.asp)  
    Canon&#8217;s first ultra-compact **with optical image stablization!** And an ISO range up to 800! This may be the first compelling replacement for my SD300.

I find the wide-angle Leica lens on the Panasonic compelling, but I&#8217;m concerned about noise &#8211; which could also be a problem for the Canon, as they both use 1/2.5&#8243; sensors. I&#8217;d prefer a larger sensor as described in the DMD article. Still, both of these cameras have some compelling advances, I can&#8217;t wait to play with them!

PS I wish I knew of a digicam site that would let me search for cameras by sensor size.

  * Every developer is a Web developer, every app is a Web app. 
      * Every service should be a microservice. 
          * Everything needs to be scalable. 
              * Every Web developer is either back-end, front-end, or full-stack. 
                  * Making software is an engineering discipline. </ul> 
                    Donâ€™t believe the hype.

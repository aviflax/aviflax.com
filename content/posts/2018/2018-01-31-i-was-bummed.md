I was bummed to learn of the demise of [@with_eve](http://witheve.com) last week, but didn’t have anything useful to say about it.

Now, though, I’m comforted and super-excited to see the launch of [@observablehq](https://observablehq.com) — it seems likely to make reactive programming drastically more accessible and widespread!

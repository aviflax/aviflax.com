I&#8217;ve been having trouble giving myself a break; I&#8217;ve been pushing myself to be productive, to the point that I&#8217;m not able to be productive. So I&#8217;m going to try a new setup: I&#8217;ll have a list of activities that I want to engage in every day (for the current stage) and a minimum amount of time and a _maximum_ amount of time for each one. This might help.

Job Search: 1-3 hours
  
Apartment Search: 30-120 mins
  
House Sale: 30-120 mins
  
Other Work: 30-60 mins
  
Recreation: 1-3 hours

Totals: 3.5 &#8211; 11 hours

Does that make sense? The max is only 11 hours&#8230; doesn&#8217;t that leave too much blank time in a day? I don&#8217;t know&#8230;

Whelp, my talk proposals to [@WriteTheDocs Portland](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2019/) and OSCON have been rejected. ðŸ˜ž Wonâ€™t stop me from going back to Write the Docs though â€” I was there last year for the first time and it was excellent. Tickets purchased! See you in May, Portland!

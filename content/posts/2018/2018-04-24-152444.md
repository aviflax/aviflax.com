I’m at [The Lead Developer conference in NYC](https://newyork2018.theleaddeveloper.com/schedule) and I’m loving it.

I’m also being reminded constantly that I [still](http://aviflax.com/post/%F0%9F%A4%94-if-one-works-as-a-member-of-a-collaborative-team/) despise the usage of “individual contributor” to describe people who are not managers. The best work is usually done in collaboration with others!

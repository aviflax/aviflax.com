You may notice that this site looks totally different. I got sick of the theme that I had created; it was just too much. For now I&#8217;m using the prefab theme [Hemingway](http://warpspire.com/hemingway).

Well, the third part of [פסח](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesah) is coming in a few hours; so I&#8217;m off for my pre-[חג](http://milon.morfix.co.il/default.aspx?q=%E7%E2) ablutions.

<strong style="font-size: x-large">חג שמח! </strong>

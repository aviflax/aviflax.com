First we lost our water on Thursday morning, and didn&#8217;t get it back until around 1:00 today! (Due to the previous tenant not paying the water bill!) A big pain! Then, just as I&#8217;m paying the plumber, I lock us out of our apartment!!!! I left a key in the inside of the door, so we couldn&#8217;t open it from the outside &#8211; the door has a fixed handle, so the only was to open it is with a key &#8211; which doesn&#8217;t work if there&#8217;s a key in the lock on the inside. Crap.

So there we are, standing outside our apartment at 14:00 on Erev Shabbat, tired, dirty, hot, and hungry, without our clothes or medicines, etc. We haven&#8217;t even brushed our teeth for 24 hours!!! Man, what a drag!!!

Thanks to the big help of our landlord Yaakov we managed to get into the apartment about 30 minutes ago, Rafi the locksmith got us in &#8211; and we got him to install a normal door lever as well, so now this can&#8217;t happen again.

Blah!

Shabbat Shalom!

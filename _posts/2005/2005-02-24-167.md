A post at [Israelity](http://www.israelity.com/index.php?p=14), [Mobius&#8217;](http://www.orthodoxanarchist.com/2005/02/beyond-conflict.php) latest project, linked me to a [NPR story](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4501255) about [Idan Raichel](http://www.teev.com/irp/), an Israeli musician that has attracted international acclaim with his mixtures of Israeli pop music and music from the Ethiopian immigrant community.

We&#8217;ve been a big fan of Raichel&#8217;s music since Ben and Bethami (who&#8217;s first kid is almost due, yay!) introduced us to his album, the Idan Raichel Project. His latest album is called ממעמקי?, &#8220;Out of the Depths&#8221;

If you&#8217;re in the States, you can order both of the albums from [Israel-Music.com](http://www.israel-music.com/the_idan_raichel's_project/) (scroll down to see the albums).

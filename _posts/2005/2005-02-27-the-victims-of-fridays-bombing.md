[This](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3051247,00.html) is a comprehensive article about the people killed in [Friday night&#8217;s bombing in Tel Aviv](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3051112,00.html). It&#8217;s really sad, especially about the couple that was going to be married in three weeks. Yael was killed and her fiance Ofer was injured, and he still hadn&#8217;t been told that Yael is dead when the article was written.

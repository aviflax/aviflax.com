Before we leave for Israel we want to upgrade our 7-month-old [Pentax Optio S4](http://pentaxusa.com/products/cameras/camera_overview.cfm?productid=18283) to the latest model, the [S4i](http://pentaxusa.com/products/cameras/camera_overview.cfm?productid=18233). So before I [eBay](http://ebay.com/) it I thought I&#8217;d see if any of our friends or family would want a _**really great**_ brand-new condition ultra-compact digicam. It&#8217;s in brand-new condition, still under warranty, and includes all the original packaging, supplies, and accessories.

The notable differences between the S4 and the newer S4i are:

  * slightly larger, brighter screen
  * movies no longer limited to 60-second clips
  * [PictBridge](http://www.cipa.jp/pictbridge/index_e.html) capability for printing directly to printers
  * Charging camera cradle instead of seperate battery charger

So, for us, these enhancements are compelling enough for us to upgrade. But for many people, especially beginners, they wouldn&#8217;t be important. So this is a chance to get a great camera at a great price!

We bought the S4 in November for $330 bottom line (post-tax, post-shipping). [PriceGrabber](http://www.pricegrabber.com/search_getprod.php?sort_type=bottomline&masterid=2424035&isbn=&pid=) shows the best bottom line price on an S4i at $333, and on a new [S4](http://www.pricegrabber.com/search_getprod.php?sort_type=bottomline&masterid=1274855&isbn=&pid=) at $293. The best price I could find on eBay for an S4 in similar condition to ours was $250.

So that&#8217;ll be the price, if anyone wants to buy it from us before we put it up on eBay &#8211; a pretty good deal, I think.

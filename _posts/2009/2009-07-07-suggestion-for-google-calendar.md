Just sent this suggestion to the Google Calendar team:

> At my org, we always try to allow Guests to modify the event. That way we can more collaboratively adjust our shared schedules. But we frequently forget to check it. It&#8217;d be very helpful for us if there was a setting to make that option checked by default for new events.

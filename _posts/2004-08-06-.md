This [hint](http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20040804025807648) introduced me to [UnicodeChecker](http://www.earthlingsoft.net/UnicodeChecker/), a highly excellent free app by earthlingsoft that helps with many different aspects of working with [Unicode](http://www.unicode.org/standard/WhatIsUnicode.html), and therefore multilingual text. The hint explains that it can be used to convert any text entered in any language into HTML entities (codes), therefore allowing the posting of text in any language to any website, even a site that doesn&#8217;t support non-western languages.

Very Cool! It would be even cooler if it worked in [FireFox](http://mozilla.org/firefox/), but that&#8217;s ok, I don&#8217;t mind switching to [Safari](http://apple.com/safari/) here and there.

The new [Carfection review of the Porsche 911 GT2 RS](https://youtu.be/Tber4uD-G8Q) is stunningly beautiful. Catchpoleâ€™s contemplative patter pairs perfectly with the images, the pace of the cuts, etc. The whole Carfection crew just keeps consistently leveling up their game; their films are a real pleasure.

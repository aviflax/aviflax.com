I’ve been playing around with the recently upgraded @GitHub Actions and it was surprisingly easy to port some CircleCI jobs. Some intriguing features!

(The jobs are a little slower, but I suspect that’s largely due to the lack of dependency caching, and [they’re working on that](https://twitter.com/mscccc/status/1166505708990263296).)

I played a _lot_ of games in 2008, with fairly varied results. Here&#8217;s a breakdown and a few words on each one:

**Finished:**

  * **[BioShock](http://www.2kgames.com/bioshock/)** – Xbox 360 – beautiful, fun, scary, creative, impressive game. Highly, highly recommended.
  * **[Half-Life 2: Episode One](http://orange.half-life2.com/hl2ep1.html)** and **[Half-Life 2: Episode Two](http://orange.half-life2.com/hl2ep2.html)** – Xbox 360 – Solid, polished, worthwhile single-player FPS&#8217;s.
  * **[Portal](http://orange.half-life2.com/portal.html)** – Xbox 360 – engaging, inventive, creative puzzle/action FPS. I did finish the game, but I liked it so much that I hope to revisit it at some point, and play it at a higher difficulty level.
  * **[World of Goo](http://worldofgoo.com/)** – Wii and Mac – see [full post](http://aviflax.com/post/world-of-goo-best-game-ever/).

**Currently Playing:**

  * **[Braid](http://braid-game.com/)** – Xbox 360 – I almost put this on the &#8220;Taking a Break&#8221; list, because I&#8217;m kinda stuck. But it&#8217;s so good, I don&#8217;t want to give up yet. Highly recommended, a great deal. And coming to PC in Q1-09.
  * **[Grand Theft Auto IV](http://www.rockstargames.com/IV/)** – Xbox 360 – is amazing on many levels, but I&#8217;m getting a little tired of the gameplay, it&#8217;s a little repetitive. That said, it&#8217;s hard to tire of driving through Liberty City and wreaking mayhem. Multiplayer is pretty good too. May move to &#8220;Taking a Break&#8221; list soon.
  * **[Halo 3](http://www.halo3.com/)** – Xbox 360 –  I bought this way back in December 2007, and actually finished the campaign a year ago, but I still play online. Especially with all the extra map packs installed, it&#8217;s still a great multiplayer game.
  * **[Spore](http://www.spore.com/)** – Mac – amazing accomplishment, but I&#8217;m semi-stuck in Tribal phase, which I find somewhat boring. I think I&#8217;ll probably get through it though – I&#8217;m really looking forward to the Civilization and Space phases.
  * **[Trism](http://www.demiforce.com/games.html)** – iPhone – an excellent puzzle game, perfect for a those small pockets of spare time in the subway or waiting in line, and a great deal at $3

I&#8217;m also currently &#8220;playing&#8221; [Wii Fit](http://www.nintendo.com/wiifit/), but I personally don&#8217;t think of it as a game, so I&#8217;m not including it here.

**Taking a Break:**

  * **[Call of Duty 4](http://www.aspyr.com/product/info/88)** – Mac – I basically bought this game just to see how well my new aluminum unibody MacBook would run a modern 3D game. Pretty well, it turns out. Too bad the game is repetitive, rigid, and ultimately boring. I&#8217;d try playing multiplayer online, but the game browser _sucks big time_. This sort of crap is what makes Xbox Live really, really great.
  * **[Mario Kart](http://www.mariokart.com/)** – Wii – I was really excited when I picked this up, but somehow it just didn&#8217;t do it for me. Maybe it&#8217;s because I was hopeful about playing it with Elina, but she wasn&#8217;t interested. Just not as much fun as [Excite Truck](http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/X-Ip9O46zi1OyeMxBFyfdI_XDV06v7Ne), I guess.
  * **[Metroid Prime 3: Corruption](http://www.metroid.com/)** – Wii – Check out that website, it&#8217;s waaaay over the top! A fun game that I really liked, but it got a little repetitive, and I was distracted by the Xbox 360 FPS&#8217;s. I do plan to take it back up at some point.
  * **[Super Mario Galaxy](http://www.supermariogalaxy.com/)** – Wii – very cool game, but I got stuck on a level (one with sand, if I remember) and it pissed me off. So I took a break. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll come back to this one soon.
  * **[Team Fortress 2](http://orange.half-life2.com/tf2.html)** – Xbox 360 – Cool game, but I had trouble finding good games to join, and never got into the mechanics. I hope to try again at some point. </ul> 
    I hope to write up some thoughts on my various gaming platforms, and also a list of games I&#8217;m looking forward to in 2009.

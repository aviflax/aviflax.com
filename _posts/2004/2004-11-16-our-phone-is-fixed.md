After a week or two of having all our incoming calls shunted to voicemail, I finally fixed our stupid network setup and everything is working again &#8211; so you can all start calling us again! Same 410 home number we&#8217;ve had for almost two years now, and we&#8217;re 7 hours ahead of US Eastern time right now. Call us!

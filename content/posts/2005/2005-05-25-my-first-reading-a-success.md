Just got back from [Tmol Shilshom](http://www.tmol-shilshom.co.il) and my first-ever public reading, with the Pardes Writing Workshop. It was a wonderful experience! I was a bit nervous/shaky as my turn approached, but not too bad. Then when I got up to the podium, I just read, mostly relaxed, and somehow it all came out right!

The crowd seemed to enjoy my pieces, and afterwards I was pleasantly surprised by all the positive feedback I received! Even some professional writers told me that my stuff was good. Even the owner of the establishment, a published writer and enthusiast of writing, gave me some really glowing compliments.

He said that my writing was excellent, then asked me something like whether I was serious about it. I answered that I wasn&#8217;t a professional writer and wasn&#8217;t studying it formally, but that I hoped to continue writing and take some classes, so who knows? He then said that my writing had that crucial combination of being &#8220;good writing&#8221; but also being down-to-earth and connecting, speaking, to people. That was really nice to hear.

All-in-all, I&#8217;m very pleased with the endeavor, tonight and with the workshop in general. So much so that I&#8217;m going to have to continue when we get settled back in the States!

I&#8217;ll be posting soon the pieces that I read tonight, just give me a few days! Photos too!

Good night!

[This essay](http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1161811238106&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter) by David J. Martin states the case for something that I have believed necessary for a few years: a system of civil marriage for Israel.

Actually, my personal position is a bit more extreme in some ways, and a bit more conciliatory in others. I believe that Israel&#8217;s consitution, if and when it is ever actually adopted, should establish that &#8220;marriage&#8221; is a religious/social construct with which the state will have nothing to do. It will recognize no marriages, and marriages will not be taken into account for any government programs or services, or any application of law. 

Instead, the constitution would establish a registry with which any two citizens could register a &#8220;civil partnership.&#8221; These civil partnerships would be used to determine taxes, inheritance, medical rights, etc. But they would not be marriages. If a couple wishes to marry, great. They can go ahead and do so, in any religious/cultural context they choose. But they&#8217;d still have to register as a civil partnership. The two states/constructs would be completely independent of each other.

I believe my proposal would be the best compromise for everyone. The religious construct of &#8220;marriage&#8221; would retain its religious character, and the state would be out of the business of dictating who can marry whom.

Anyone know any of the drafters of the draft constitutions?

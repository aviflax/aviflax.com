> Ms. Banerjee&#8217;s interesting story points out, in a few different ways, the &#8220;lossy&#8221; nature of the conversion of scripture to the graphic novel format &#8211; particularly that much of the text &#8220;ends up on the cutting room floor&#8221;, in favor of &#8220;action and epic&#8221;. The story would have benefited from a counter-example: JT Waldman&#8217;s Megillat Esther is a graphic novel of the Book of Esther which, in addition to stunning original art illustrating the entire story, contains the complete original Hebrew text along with an English translation.

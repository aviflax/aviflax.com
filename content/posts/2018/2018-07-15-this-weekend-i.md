This weekend I picked up some recent Batman comics from the [Baltimore County Public Library](https://www.bcpl.info/) in Towson, MD after reading [this thoughtful review](https://kottke.org/18/07/batmans-wedding) by [Tim Carmody](https://www.patreon.com/tcarmody), and I was blown away by [Tom King](https://twitter.com/TomKingTK)â€™s writing. Phenomenal!

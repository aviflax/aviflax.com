I just released a [new version][release] of [FC4][fc4], a [FLOSS][floss] framework for authoring,
publishing, and maintaining [C4][c4] software architecture diagrams.

The (abbreviated) highlights:

* Rendering multiple diagrams is faster and more efficient
* The versioning scheme has changed to work better with [Homebrew][brew]

The release notes contain more details, including upgrading instructions.

I’d welcome any feedback you’d care to share!

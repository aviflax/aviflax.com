[Gilly posted](http://gilbenmori.blogspot.com/2005/01/agunot-special-screening-of-mekudeshet.html) a reminder that this film is being screened tonight by Young Hadassa-Israel. It&#8217;s an award-winning film about the problem of Agunot in Orthodox Judaism. I&#8217;m going to try to make it; if I do, I will post my impressions here.

_Edit: I&#8217;m not gonna make it tonight. One of my teachers tells me that it&#8217;s an excellent film but can be somewhat depressing._

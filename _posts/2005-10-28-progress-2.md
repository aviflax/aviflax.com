Well it&#8217;s been a nice couple of days &#8211; yesterday we signed a lease for our new apartment in Park Slope! Check out <a href=http://flaxfamily.com/post/28-october-2005-progress/">the details</a> over at our family site.

And this morning I had a good job interview, with an interesting company. I think the interview went well, and I&#8217;m looking forward to hearing from them.

As soon as I get a job, I&#8217;m excited to start biking into Manhattan from the new place. Google Maps says it&#8217;s 10.6 kilometers to the company that I interviewed with today (just as an example). I can definitely do that &#8211; it was 11.5 to my last job in Baltimore, and the terrain in NY is _much_ less hilly. Yeah, it should be just right &#8211; I think I&#8217;ll be able to get to work in about the same time as taking the subway &#8211; and get exercise &#8211; but not work up such a sweat that I&#8217;d need a shower in the office.

One thing that would make that bike commute more comfortable would be proper clothing &#8211; I&#8217;d like to figure out what kind of clothing and outerwear I could bike in, during the winter, without working up a huge sweat and without freezing. I know there&#8217;s an answer to this question somewhere. Just gotta do the research.

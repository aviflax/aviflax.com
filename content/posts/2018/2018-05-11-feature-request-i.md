title: Feature Request I Just Sent to GitHub for their API

> Hi, I’m writing some scripts to help my company manage our large set of repos, and one thing we’d like to be able to do is to disallow forking of repos via the API. I tried searching for this capability pretty thoroughly, and as far as I can tell, it isn’t present in either the V3 nor V4 APIs.
> 
> So, this is my feature request: please add this capability to either or both the V3 and/or the V4 APIs.
> 
> To be clear, I’m referring to the setting on the repo settings page labeled “Allow forking” — I’d like the ability to toggle this setting on and off.
> 
> Thank you!
> Avi

Filed our tax returns last night! **Four whole days** before the deadline. Whoohoo! And a _very nice_ refund. Excellent!

My two video projects are coming to a close and will hopefully be at a DVD dupe shop tomorrow.

Plans are firming up for the Pesach break and our family visit. We&#8217;re planning to spend Hol Hamoed up north. Should be nice!

Later!

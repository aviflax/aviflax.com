> Starting yesterday, and finalising on May 15, [Slack is ending support for open standards IRC and XMPP](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201727913-Connect-to-Slack-over-IRC-and-XMPP). This is hugely disappointing, and just shows how easy it is to be ensnared by silos. So many FL/OSS communities moved to Slack from IRC.

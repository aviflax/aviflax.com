For the second exercise of this meeting, Ilene read the Torah portion of that week, Yitro, in Exodus. 17:14 talks about memory, so she suggested that we write about a memory. In 18:18-19 Yitro advises Moses that he is taking on too much, and he needs help. Ilene suggested that we write about something that someone needs help with. I went with that. I came up with this:

> Who needs help?
  
> I don&#8217;t need help. If it doesn&#8217;t kill me, I&#8217;ll be stronger.
  
> Stronger is better, better than weaker.
  
> I don&#8217;t want to fail
  
> don&#8217;t want to feel failure
  
> I&#8217;ll need my strength to succeed.
  
> But if it&#8217;s help I need
  
> to fulfill all those deeds
  
> then I&#8217;m damned if I do and damned if I don&#8217;t.
  
> failure is stalking
  
> weakness is here
  
> pounding on my door
  
> to whom can I appeal?
  
> I don&#8217;t need help &#8211;
        
> I&#8217;m no failure.

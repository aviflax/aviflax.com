Today was my first day as a software developer at [Modern Energy](https://modern.energy/)! Iâ€™m thrilled to be joining the fight to mitigate climate change. 

Special thanks to [Luke VanderHart](https://twitter.com/levanderhart) for introducing me, and to [Bret Victor][bv] for  his inspiring essay [What can a Technologist do About Climate Change?](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/)

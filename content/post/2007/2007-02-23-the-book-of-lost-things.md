[Reuben](http://flickr.com/photos/avi4now/tags/reuben) loaned me [this wonderful book](http://www.thebookoflostthings.com/) by [John Conolly](http://www.johnconnollybooks.com/), and it had me laughing out loud on the subway, staying up way past by bedtime just to finish a chapter, and then tiptoeing around our apartment late at night, spooked. 

It&#8217;s a modern fairy tale with suburb rhythm and pace &#8211; it&#8217;s a quick read, but when I turned the last page I had that contradictory combination of elation, satisfaction, and disappointment which accompanies only the best books: the elation and satisfaction of a story well told and enjoyed, and the disappointment that it&#8217;s over &#8211; which is tempered by the reluctant recognition that had it been any longer, it wouldn&#8217;t have been the same book. It was just right.

Of course, now I have to go and read every single other book Mr. Connolly has written. What a hardship.

In the meantime, why don&#8217;t you read [the first chapter](http://www.johnconnollybooks.com/novels_lost_chap.html), and let me know how you like it!

Thanks Reuben!

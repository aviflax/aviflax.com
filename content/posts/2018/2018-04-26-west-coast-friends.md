West coast friends: I’ll be in SF next week (visiting my closest Funding Circle office) and Portland over the weekend (and part of the following week) for [the Write The Docs conference](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2018/)! Let’s hang out!

Also: join me at [the Tech Solidarity event on Tuesday night in SF](https://techsolidarity.org/events/sf_may_1_2018.html)!

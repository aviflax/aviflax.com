Google had nothing on this, so just to document it, here&#8217;s the procedure:

  1. In calendar view, choose File->Import
  2. Choose &#8220;Import holidays&#8221;, click next
  3. Check the holiday sets you wish to import. I chose USA, Israel, and Jewish. Click next.
  4. That&#8217;s it!

Enjoy!

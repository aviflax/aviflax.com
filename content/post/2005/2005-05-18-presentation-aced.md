My presentation in חומש class today with my הברותה Leah went really well. Leah and I and both enjoyed it and so did the other students. It was a great relief, I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s done and I feel good about it, accomplished. Now I can resume working on other things that I put off the past few days (if I owe you a phone call, sorry!)

In a couple of days I&#8217;ll post the handouts that we used and my narrative prose version of the story that we tackled &#8211; the incident of Reuben and Bilhah from בר?שית לה.

לילה טוב!

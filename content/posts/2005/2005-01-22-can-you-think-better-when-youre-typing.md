Fascinating [discussion on cognitive differences between handwriting and typing](http://www.collisiondetection.net/mt/archives/001095.html). I&#8217;ve thought often about this kind of thing. I personally find that I think far better at a keyboard than with paper. I&#8217;m starting to come close to abandoning pen and paper altogether. When I&#8217;m in a class, I have my laptop record the discussion while I type key phrases. And I stopped using paper long ago for personal organization, or communication.

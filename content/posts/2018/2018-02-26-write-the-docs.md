Registering for [@WriteTheDocs Portland](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2018/) (early May, excited!) and the registration form is quite thoughtful.

I really like that many of the questions are text boxes so I can supply real and nuanced answers.

I especially like that the race/ethnicity question is free-form; I entered:

> Jewish but I’m generally read as “white”

which is how I feel but I rarely have the ability to identify this way.

This reminds me of [You Are Not a Gadget](http://www.jaronlanier.com/gadgetwebresources.html) by Jaron Lanier — a seminal work that really lodged a few ideas in my brain.

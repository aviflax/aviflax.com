I&#8217;m in the process of moving this website to a new [WebHost](http://austindev.com/), so things may be a little out of whack for a little while.

In other news, I&#8217;m enjoying being unemployed. I highly recommend it!

As for the future: Elina and I are planning to be in Jerusalem for the next school year, roughly July 2004 to July 2005. We&#8217;re very excited!

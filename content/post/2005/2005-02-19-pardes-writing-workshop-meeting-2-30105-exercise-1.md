The suggested theme for this exercise was not trusting the strangers &#8211; based on the commandment in the Torah: &#8220;Do not oppress the stranger.&#8221; We had about a half hour for this one and I hemmed, hawed, and hedged for most of it, until when I had five or ten minutes left I came up with this:

> I&#8217;m a stranger every day. When I walk into a store for the first time, I&#8217;m judged by the storekeeper, she looks at my sweaty face and my untied shoes and calls me slacker in her mind. She wouldn&#8217;t say that about her son, or her husband. But I&#8217;m a stranger so it&#8217;s ok. My strangerness is what makes her love with her husband or her sister something special, so it&#8217;s ok.
> 
> When I raise my hand in class to ask a question, I know that no one else is asking my question. So I mumble it or say it really fast or keep my eyes down on the table so I don&#8217;t have to see how the people in the room are looking at me. They&#8217;re all so comfortable, so belonging. The moment they see me there&#8217;s a separation. There&#8217;s them and there&#8217;s me. I&#8217;m a stranger because I don&#8217;t know what the cab driver is asking me, because I don&#8217;t know how to cash a check in the bank. When I walk around I know that I&#8217;m not wearing the same kind of clothes as the people here, the ones that belong. But I can&#8217;t tell exactly what it is about my clothes that&#8217;s so different – I guess that&#8217;s part of what makes me a stranger.
> 
> Then I go home, and I&#8217;m not a stranger there. My cat is there and my sofa and my conical glass mug with the handle that&#8217;s just a little too small – they&#8217;re mine, I know them and they know me. We trust each other and we know all our little foibles, that&#8217;s the place where the love sits. So when I go outside again tomorrow to be a stranger again, it&#8217;ll only be for a while, only for the day, until I go home &#8211; so it&#8217;s ok. 

I noted some feedback:

  * C: mix between mature and immature voice the middle flowed better
  * I: liked “the place where the love sits?
  * E: repetition of being a stranger. Show it instead of stating it.
  * S: this is similar in feel to the thunder piece but has an added dimension – more contrast to another voice. Scratched the surface.
  * J: it got rushed to an ending. The time constraint could be felt at the end. Feel free to let things dangle – otherwise you might cut something off.

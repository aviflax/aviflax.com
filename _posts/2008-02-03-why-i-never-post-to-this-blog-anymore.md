Perfectionism.

That&#8217;s it, pretty much. I&#8217;ll go into some more detail, but every single reason will boil down to that same single root cause.

**I want every post to be an essay.** Which is not possible. I barely have time to write a sentence, let alone a well-constructed and cogent missive. End result: I write nothing.

**I&#8217;m spend 95% of my energy on [my business](http://arc90.com).** Balance? Feh. Since I became a partner a few months ago, I&#8217;ve definitely cut back on my &#8220;personal life&#8221;. Whatever that is.

**[The paradox of choice.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory#Paradox_of_choice)** When I have a thought, an idea, a photo, that I want to get down or share, first I have to decide _where_ I should do so. I currently have four blogs: [aviflax.com](http://aviflax.com/), my &#8220;personal&#8221; blog, intended for words which are clearly and definitively my own, and not endorsed by my family or my company; [flaxfamily.com](http://flaxfamily.com), my &#8220;family&#8221; blog, for news about or from both Elina and I; [the Arc90 blog](http://blog.arc90.com/), and just for good measure, a private Arc90 internal blog. It&#8217;s not always clear where a post should go: if I&#8217;m writing about technology, it&#8217;s equally appropriate at aviflax.com and arc90.com. If I&#8217;m writing about my personal life &#8211; a trip, news, etc &#8211; it could go on aviflax.com or flaxfamily.com. Cross-posting is an OK answer, but it&#8217;s a pain. Having to make these choices is enough extra work that it can discourage me from writing anything in the first place. 

**I&#8217;m really behind in my correspondence.** I am seriously behind in writing some people who are important to me, and I feel bad about it. Any time I consider taking some time to write a blog post, I struggle with feelings of guilt, and think about whether I should really be writing letters. This experience is taxing enough to discourage me from writing anything.

I feel as though there must be a few more reasons I&#8217;m missing, but that&#8217;s a perfectionist feeling, so I&#8217;m gonna ignore it. It&#8217;s not as if those aren&#8217;t enough reasons!

* * *

I have a few ideas to improve the situation:

**Allow myself to write shorter posts.** I&#8217;m thinking of adding [&#8220;microblogging&#8221;](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro-blogging) to my blogs, Ã  la [twitter](http://twitter.com). I should also construct my templates to make titles optional. Titles are great for essays, but less so for quick thoughts. They require one to summarize, to declare intent. I&#8217;d like that work to be optional.

**Be a little saner about work.** I&#8217;m not yet sure exactly how I&#8217;m going to do this, but I think it might have something to do with leaving the office after nine or ten hours, hiring more people, zooming my role out, and being firmer about setting less-crazy deadlines.

**Integrate my personal blogs.** 90% of the content at aviflax.com and flaxfamily.com is relevant to both sites. So I think I need to go back to having them both run in a single instance of WordPress, with each site just being an alternate view to mostly the same content &#8211; a filter, if you will. At flaxfamily.com you&#8217;d see more family stuff and less tech stuff, and vice versa. But from a publishing perspective it&#8217;d be a single blog.

**Cross-post more often.** Rather than taking 60 seconds to decide where to post a post, I&#8217;ll just cross-post by default.

**Commit to a desktop editor.** I&#8217;m writing this in [Marsedit](http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/), and it&#8217;s really quite good. I&#8217;ve dithered on this before, liking the portability of a web interface. But the latency and the multiple steps required have turned out to be discouraging factors.
  
**Make my blog content more dynamic and diverse,** by bringing in aspects of a [Tumblelog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumblelog).

**Allow myself to start over with my correspondence.** Basically, I need to apologize to my friends, ask for a clean slate, and start over. And in the future I&#8217;ll try to be more casual about correspondence in general. Maybe I&#8217;ll try practicing [five.sentenc.es](http://five.sentenc.es/). After all, five sentences is a lot better than zero.

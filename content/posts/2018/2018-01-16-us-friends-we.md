US friends! We have a chance to [strike a blow for freedom today](https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/953319219273322497) — the Senate is about to vote to renew authorization of warrantless surveillance of Americans. Call your senator & tell them to defend the 4th amendment & vote NO on S.139!

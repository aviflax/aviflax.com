Wondering where you can pick up Jerusalem&#8217;s public WiFi service? Check out the [map](http://www.jerusalem.muni.il/unwire/english/map.htm) or the [list](http://www.jerusalem.muni.il/english/sys/tour/show_sites.asp?site_type=263&sortBy=site_name&SortDirect=&historySteps=3&posit=1) of hotspots.

In addition to Jerusalem&#8217;s public wifi, many cafes also have their own hotspots for customers. I know of three on Emek Refaim Street: Coffee Mill, Coffee Shop, and Tal Bagels.

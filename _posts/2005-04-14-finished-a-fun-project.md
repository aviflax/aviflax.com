Just shipped out a DVD project for [Pardes](http://pardes.org.il/) &#8211; it was very rushed, but still fun.

I may have a online version of the video soon, have to check with the school first.

I learned a lot doing this project, and I also got a lot of great feedback. People were really pleased and impressed with my work. I like that!

Gimme comments!!!!!!!! Yes, YOU!

You&#8217;ve got to watch these [amazing commercials](http://www.leftlanenews.com/2006/02/22/vw-strikes-again-un-pimp-my-ride-videos/).

These commercials, and Honda UK&#8217;s wonderful [Civic Choir](http://www.flurl.com/uploaded/Honda_Civic_Choir_43459.html) ad, support my theory that good advertising is moving towards having to be good entertainment. TiVO helped push this, and I like it.

It won&#8217;t be long before we only see ads that we&#8217;d _want_ to see. That&#8217;ll be nice!

There&#8217;s something just really _nice_ about the Open Software Development movement. It&#8217;s this feeling that anyone can collaborate on anything with anyone else. If a person has something to contribute, then it&#8217;s accepted &#8211; no politics, positioning, elitism, etc. It&#8217;s a very friendly and egalitarian world. (I also [touched on](http://flaxfamily.com/post/great-deal-on-digital-slr/#comment-930) this last night at [flaxfamily.com](http://flaxfamily.com/).)

I had downloaded [Anders Hultman&#8217;s](http://anders.hultman.nu) program [exifcleaner](http://anders.hultman.nu/data/exifcleaner/) to clean up the exif headers in the jpeg files in our iPhoto library to fix an iPhoto bug involving our Pentax Optio S (whew! writeup coming soon, to be x-posted to [Mac OS X Hints](http://www.macosxhints.com))

Annnyway, I ended up modifying his program a bit so it could process an entire tree of files, instead of just one at a time. Just to be nice I sent my modification back to Anders. I just received his reply:

> Adding recursive scan was a really good idea! I&#8217;d never thought of that, but you really put me on the right track with your addition. Portability is cruical, however, so I didn&#8217;t use your code after all, but wrote my own based on File::Find.

Cool! This means that I had a part in a new feature being added to this software. I like it!

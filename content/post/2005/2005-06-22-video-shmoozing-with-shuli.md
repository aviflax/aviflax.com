Just a little snippet of the girls shmoozing at Shuli&#8217;s party on Sunday. This might qualify as a [vlog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlog) post, I&#8217;m not sure.

The video is encoded in the new [H.264 codec](http://www.apple.com/quicktime/technologies/h264/) by [QuickTime 7](http://www.apple.com/quicktime/) – and you&#8217;ll need QuickTime Player 7 to watch it, as far as I can tell – VLC 0.8.1 seems to choke on the file.

[Download QuickTime Player 7 for Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/mac.html)

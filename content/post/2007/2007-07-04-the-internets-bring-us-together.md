Seven months ago, I took this photo of a somewhat funny/ironic auto breakdown in Miami Beach. I posted it to [my Flickr account](http://www.flickr.com/photos/avi4now/), thinking it was mildly humorous and mostly harmless. Well, a few days ago the driver of that auto somehow stumbled across that photo (or was he looking for it?) and commented on it! A conversation ensued. [Check it out.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/avi4now/325243257/) The world gets smaller every day. Combine that with overpopulation, and it&#8217;s getting pretty claustrophobic on this planet!

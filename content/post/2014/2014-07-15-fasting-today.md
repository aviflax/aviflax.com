title: Fasting Today
url: /post/fasting-today/
---
I’m fasting today — both because it’s a traditional Jewish fast day and as part of a “hunger strike against violence” wherein some Jews and Muslims around the world are dedicating today’s traditional fasts (for [the 17th of Tammuz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeenth_of_Tammuz) and [Ramadan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan)) to end the conflict between Israel and Palestinians. There are a few different Facebook events and Internet campaigns for this idea, so I’m not sure where it started, but I find it compelling. I’ve felt powerless to do anything meaningful about the situation, and prayer is tough for me these days, but fasting — that I can do.

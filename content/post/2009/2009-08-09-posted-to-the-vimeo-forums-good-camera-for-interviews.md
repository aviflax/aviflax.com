I just posted [this](http://vimeo.com/forums/topic:16329) to the [Vimeo Cameras and Editing forum](http://vimeo.com/forum:cameras_and_editing):

  <p>
    Hi, I&#8217;m a total beginner with video, and I have a project that I&#8217;d like to start: interviewing my wife&#8217;s grandparents about their experiences during the Holocaust.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I thought I&#8217;d use my Canon HF100, but during some test shots, my wife&#8217;s face was a little distorted — it was a little wider than in real life. I&#8217;m concerned that there&#8217;s something about the lens of this camera that&#8217;s leading to a less-than-natural perspective.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This is beyond the scope of my expertise at this point, but I know I&#8217;ve read that different focal lengths distort proportions in different ways. In still cameras, I&#8217;ve read that a focal length of 80–90mm (35mm equiv) is preferred for &#8220;portraits&#8221;.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Looking at the stats of the HF100, the focal length ranges from 42–514mm (35mm equiv) — which makes me think that I should be able to get a zoom level around 80–90mm, which theoretically, I&#8217;d guess, would give me natural results. Since the camera has no precise focal length indicator, however, I&#8217;m not sure how to do this, except perhaps by guessing and trial and error, which seems… iffy.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Also, in my test shots, I was zoomed way in… I&#8217;d say maybe 350–450mm, guesstimating. Shouldn&#8217;t the proportions at those focal lengths have been decent?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I did some test shots with my DSLR, with a 50mm lens, which with my APS-C sensor has about an 85mm equivalent — it&#8217;s supposedly near-perfect as a &#8220;portrait lens&#8221;. Those shots came out nearly perfect — so there&#8217;s at least *something* to all this focal length stuff. I&#8217;m just not sure if there&#8217;s a problem with the HF100 itself, or how I&#8217;m using it.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I&#8217;m hoping someone might be able to give me some guidance here, on:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (1) am I thinking accurately about focal lengths?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (2) might the HF100 be capable of achieving accurate, attractive, and natural-looking proportions of interview subjects?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (3) if not, can anyone recommend a good camera for this purpose? I&#8217;m thinking perhaps I&#8217;ll just get a DSLR with video capability, and use my 50mm lens… but I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;ll really work well either.

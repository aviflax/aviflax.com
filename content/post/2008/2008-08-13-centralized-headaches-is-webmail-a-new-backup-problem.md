title: Centralized Headaches &#8211; Is Webmail a New Backup Problem?

My business partner Rich recently posted [Centralized Headaches](http://www.basement.org/2008/08/centralized_headaches.html), wherein he points out that Gmail&#8217;s recent downtime caused more problems for more people than it really should have, because people have over-relied on Gmail, to the point where many don&#8217;t have a local backup of their mail, or even a mail client &#8211; that in some ways, webmail, which moves _everything_ to the cloud, has been a step backwards from the traditional client-server mail setup, where partial connectivity was a given.

It got me thinking, so I posted this comment:

> Good points, Rich. I&#8217;d like to note that there&#8217;s a related issue: backup. Most people don&#8217;t backup their data, even that which is crucial to them. I think the basic reason for that is that it&#8217;s always been way to complicated to do so. Apple&#8217;s Time Machine offers some hope in that area; it boils backup down to its essence, and hides the complexity, so average people can backup without too many hassles. And that&#8217;s great. But consider that it took _twenty-four years_ — from the release of the first Mac to that of OS X 10.5 Leopard with Time Machine — for us to come up with a simple, reliable, effective, and affordable solution to desktop backup for average people — and it&#8217;s _still_ not built-in to the most common OS. And — the irony — just when we&#8217;re _finally_ on the cusp of slaying that dragon — at least for Mac users — the game goes ahead and changes! Now people are keeping their data _off_ of their desktops, on _other &#8220;people&#8217;s&#8221; computers!_ Now we have this entirely new dimension to the problem, and once again, it&#8217;s being approached haphazardly, obliquely, and without coordination.

> You focus here (as you frequently do) on the divide between the web and the desktop. That&#8217;s one way of looking at the problem. But if you look at it from the perspective of backup, you could re-frame the problem as a rule: _important data should always exist in more than one place_. And by &#8220;place&#8221;, I mean &#8220;responsible party&#8221; — I&#8217;m sure Google has a strong backup plan, but if they hold the only copy of one&#8217;s data, and their system goes down, that means that the data is at least unavailable for some period of time.

I set up a desktop mail client to synchronize with my Gmail accounts using IMAP, which means I have not only a backup of my mail, but a local working copy — if Gmail goes down, I can still read and send mail.

> The thing is, that&#8217;s all well and good for me, but I&#8217;m a geek. I have no illusions that we can expect average people to set up or use such a setup. So I agree with you that it&#8217;s time for the cloud service providers to step up and try to address this problem, on the behalf of their users. Gmail, for example, should provide a &#8220;Gmail Desktop&#8221; application, which would store all of a user&#8217;s mail locally and synchronize with the service. When on their own computer, a user could use the app, which would automatically provide the benefits of backup and offline use, on the fly, in the background; when away from their own computer they could still, of course, use the web interface.

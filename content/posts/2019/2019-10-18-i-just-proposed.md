I just proposed a ⚡️ lightning talk for [the next Write the Docs NYC meetup](https://www.meetup.com/WriteTheDocsNYC/events/265751514/): _Storytelling with Git_.

<img src="uploads/2019/e62b749c3c.jpg" width="600" height="277" alt="Screenshot of a Web form (a Google Forms… form) showing the field “Talk title” with the value “Storytelling with Git” and “Talk description” with “I’ll show how documentarians and developers can document the ongoing story of their projects with Git, and explain why they should. I prepared this for WtD Portland this past May but I was bumped due to time constraints. I have a slide deck prepared that I’d be happy to share if you’d like to see it. Thanks for organizing!”" />

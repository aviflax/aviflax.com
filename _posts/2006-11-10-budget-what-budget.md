It&#8217;s a good thing we don&#8217;t live in Brooklyn Heights! We had dinner there tonight at a kosher vegan restaurant called [The Greens](http://menupages.com/restaurantdetails.asp?areaid=0&restaurantid=10201&neighborhoodid=0&cuisineid=0). Afterward, I wandered around a bit, and found [Heights Books](http://www.heightsbooks.com/) &#8211; just the kind of used book shop that I love &#8211; stuffed with stacks and piles of books of all sorts; a deep selection and decent prices. I browsed a few different sections, but ended up buying three books:

  * [Hebrew: The Eternal Language](http://www.questia.com/library/book/hebrew-the-eternal-language-by-william-chomsky.jsp) by William Chomsky
  * [Women & Jewish law](http://www.amazon.com/Women-Jewish-Law-Essential-Relevance/dp/0805210490/) by Rachel Biale &#8211; who apparently [agrees with](http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/21661/edition_id/440/format/html/displaystory.html) my [ideas](http://aviflax.com/post/jerusalem-post-publishes-op-ed-on-civil-marriage-in-israel/) on marriage and government &#8211; except hers came first!
  * [Back To The Sources: Reading the Classic Jewish Texts](http://www.amazon.com/Back-Sources-Reading-Classic-Jewish/dp/0671605968/), edited by [Barry W. Holtz](http://www.jtsa.edu/progs/edu/baholtz/index.shtml)

All three books looked very interesting _and_ potentially rare or expensive; so I splurged and bought them &#8211; although I didn&#8217;t do too badly, because I returned three other books to the shelf, so I could have bought six. I also checked out the prices of these books online, and I definitely saved money on all of them.

After the bookshop, I started heading to the subway, but was waylaid again, this time by [St. Mark&#8217;s Comics](http://stmarkscomics.com/). It&#8217;s been a few years since I was in a real comic shop, so I couldn&#8217;t resist just stepping in for a quick peek at what&#8217;s going on in comics. And of course, I asked about my favorite comic-book series [ElfQuest](http://elfquest.com), and ended up buying [ElfQuest: The Discovery #1](http://www.paperbackreader.com/review.php?ReviewID=1204), first of a four-issue mini-series.

Ah well, I guess I&#8217;ll just have to scrimp and save&#8230; until I pick up my new Wii on the 19th!

g&#8217;night!

I&#8217;m a bit behind posting this, but I think that&#8217;s understandable, since I&#8217;ve been moving ([done](http://flaxfamily.com/post/good-news/ "post at flaxfamily.com about our move")) and job-hunting/negotiating. Last Thursday, while driving our second (and hopefully last) moving truck from Baltimore to Brooklyn, I made a call and accepted a job!

The company is [Arc 90](http://arc90.com/ "The Arc 90 website is a currently bit bland, but I've been assured that's only temporary."), a year-old internet firm. I anticipate exciting opportunities to be innovative and creative &#8211; to innovate and to create. I&#8217;m starting tomorrow!

The office in in midtown Manhattan, on Madison Avenue between 47<sup>th</sup> and 48<sup>th</sup> streets. I&#8217;m planning to bike to work! According to Google it&#8217;s 6.6 miles. Today I did a practice ride just to get a feel for it &#8211; it&#8217;s a good ride, exactly one hour door-to-door. That&#8217;s almost exactly the same as the subway, so I&#8217;m not seeing any downsides to this plan &#8211; I save money, get exercise, get healthy, get outdoors, and don&#8217;t lose any time!

My only real challenge with the biking is finding some good gear &#8211; starting with socks! I need do so something about excessive sweat&#8230; don&#8217;t want to kill any co-workers with my odor!

OK, off to bed for me, gonna get an early start tomorrow! Goodnight!

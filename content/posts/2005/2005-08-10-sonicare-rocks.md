Avi&#8217;s Mom gave us the [Sonicare Advance 4700 Power Toothbrush](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00008BFXI/) for our 3<sup>rd</sup> anniversary. We&#8217;ve been using it for a week or two now, and we&#8217;re both thrilled with it. It&#8217;s really a joy to use, it makes us enjoy brushing! Our teeth feel cleaner than ever. Highly recommended! Thanks Mom!

There&#8217;s a ton of coverage on the net about Google Base, I&#8217;ll link some soon.

For now I just want to note that if you search the base and add a location criteria to your search (located within X miles of a given location) then Google Base lists the results, but also displays them on a map.

Why is that a big deal? Well, basically, once Base is well-populated, you&#8217;ll be able to visually browse **anything** that has a location associated with it. Does that seem like a big deal? Really, it shouldn&#8217;t. This is exactly how easy it _should_ have been, for a while now. But that&#8217;s one of the great things about Google &#8211; they&#8217;re pushing the present towards the future, making information useful, making the net work like it should.

Curious? Check out [all used Honda S2000&#8217;s within 45 miles of US postal code 11215](http://base.google.com/base/search?q=s2000&a_r=1&nd=1&scoring=aa_152&us=0&a_n152=location&a_y152=6&a_s152=0&a_o152=0&a_v152=11215&a_t152=45&a_n335=model&a_y335=1&a_s335=0&a_o335=0&a_v335=s2000&a_n208=condition&a_y208=1&a_s208=0&a_o208=0&a_v208=used&a_n296=make&a_y296=1&a_s296=0&a_o296=0&a_v296=honda&a_v296=). Crazy.

(It&#8217;s not limited to the US, I also got jobs in London.)

This past שבת we had some friends over for a mexican-style meal. It was fun! We had a friend over who&#8217;s from some place called &#8220;California&#8221; and said that the food really reminded him of home (wherever _that_ is).

Thought I&#8217;d share our menu:

  * [Vegan Black Bean Soup](http://vegetarian.allrecipes.com/az/VgnBlckBnSp.asp?tsrc=ef) (served cold with sour cream)
  * [Easy Guacamole](http://vegetarian.allrecipes.com/az/EasyGuacamole.asp?tsrc=ef)
  * [Artichoke Salsa](http://appetizer.allrecipes.com/az/rtichkSls.asp?tsrc=ef)
  * [Mexican Cucumber Salad](http://salad.allrecipes.com/az/MxicnCcmbrSld.asp?tsrc=ef)
  * Avi&#8217;s Pepper & Hearts of Palm Salad
  * Israeli Lemonade with Mint & Watermelon (first tried this at a חומוסיה in תל ?ביב
  * Corn Tortillas and Tortilla Chips

It was a total success! Rave reviews and lots of fun!

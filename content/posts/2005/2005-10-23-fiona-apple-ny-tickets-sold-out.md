Damn! I&#8217;ve never had a chance to hear [Fiona Apple](http://www.fiona-apple.com/ "Official site") live and now that she&#8217;s starting a tour to support her finally-released album Extraordinary Machine (which is excellent, I recommend the [DualDisc](http://dualdisc.com/ "The official DualDisc website explains what it is and how it works.")) I was excited to attend a show.

But of course, tickets are sold out for the show I had in mind, in New York on Sunday, December 11. They went on sale yesterday! So now I can either buy the tickets for a 50% markup on eBay, or I can settle for the Boston show on Wednesday, 12/07 or the Philly show on Thursday, 12/08.

Dammit. I&#8217;m so annoyed that concert tickets are always going on sale on Saturdays!

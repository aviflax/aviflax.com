(“Nana” is what I called my mother’s mother. According to [dictionary.com](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/nana) this usage is chiefly from the northeastern United States.)

She died without much suffering while on hospice at a home for people afflicted by Alzheimer’s disease, where she’d been for over ten years. I miss her, but I’ve missed her for years now — she hadn’t really been with us for most of those ten years. I’m glad that her ordeal, and our family’s ordeal, is over, and that she no longer exists in that limbo state of being alive, and yet in some ways not fully alive. Now we can remember her as she was when she was strong, in the many ways that she was strong.

Strength is the main trait that comes to mind when I think of her. She was strong, opinionated, and not a little stubborn. She was passionate about classical music and the visual arts, and she always tried to share her passions with me — but she never pushed them on me. She also made a point of being informed on current events, which made an impression on me — my own drive to stay informed is partly due to her example.

In the years to come, as I, God willing, raise my soon-to-be-born daughter, I hope my memories of my nana, and the examples she set for me, help me raise her to be strong and to partake of what the world has to offer. Her memory will be a blessing.<figure> <figcaption>My nana, me, and my mom at my wedding on 21 July 2002:</figcaption>

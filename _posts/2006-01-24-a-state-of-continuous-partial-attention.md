Rejoice, O ye hordes, I have acquired for myself &#8212; a mobile phone.

However, I&#8217;m not quite stupid enough to post the number up here for Google to do with as it will.

If you wanna reach me when I&#8217;m out and about, send email to my mobile: the address is **mobile _at_ aviflax _dot_ com**.

I&#8217;ll be sending out a mass email soon to friends and family with the number, but if you want it sooner, just ask!

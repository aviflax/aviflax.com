Yasser Arafat finally died last night. In an effort to counter all the inevitable fawning hoopla, [Honest Reporting](http://www.honestreporting.com/) has released two resources: a 60-second online film called [Arafat&#8217;s Legacy](http://www.honestreporting.com/arafat "short film on Yasser Arafat's Legacy") and a [detailed biography](http://www.honestreporting.com/articles/45884734/reports/Yassir_Arafat3_1929-2004.asp "detailed biography of Yasser Arafat's life").

Posting these links is part of my effort to counter the rash of misinformation that I know will now flood the global media, glorifying and lauding this terrorist as a freedom fighter, a hero, a peace activist. Hopefully Google will pick up on my links and include these pages in its search results. Honest Reporting doesn&#8217;t seem to have picked up on the importance of seeding the Google index &#8211; they&#8217;re really missing a crucial piece of the puzzle.

Trying to &#8220;borrow&#8221; your neighbor&#8217;s WiFi signal but can&#8217;t get decent reception in every room? Check out the [D-Link DWL-G710 Wireless Range Extender](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0006698SS/) &#8211; just plug it in anywhere in your home/office, no wires required. After the 60-second setup procedure, you&#8217;ve just &#8220;boosted&#8221; that pesky signal by 50-100%! Now you can enjoy that WiFi goodness wherever your muse requests it.

Nice!

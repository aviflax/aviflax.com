I finished Kim Stanley Robinson’s new novel [_Red Moon_](https://www.kimstanleyrobinson.info/content/red-moon) last night. I thoroughly enjoyed it! As seems to be usual for his works, it’s a great mix of characters, ideas, and plot that combine into a compelling and thought-provoking experience. Similarly to his excellent _New York 2140_ it manages to remain entertaining while conveying his vibrant geopolitical ideas.

Finished [Wrestling with God & Men: Homosexuality in the Jewish Tradition](http://www.wisc.edu/wisconsinpress/books/2576.htm) by [Rabbi Steven Greenberg](http://www.clal.org/clal_faculty_sg.html). The core of the book is an attempt to provide alternate readings and interpretations of verses in the Torah that have traditionally been interpreted as forbidding homosexual activity, and to help Orthodox Jews interact with the issue of homosexuality and religion in a compassionate and reasonable way.

I liked the book, I think it was well written &#8211; it&#8217;s thoughtful, insightful, and careful, as it should be. As for the content, the conclusions &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure, I&#8217;ll have to think those over for a little while. More later.

I&#8217;ve been pretty happy with my pannier bag made by Timbuk2. It&#8217;s a &#8220;convertible&#8221;, meaning the clips which attach it to a cargo rack can be secured with some Velcro straps, so one can quickly and easily pull it off a bike, pull out the shoulder strap, and use it as a slightly awkward and slightly uncomfortable shoulder/messenger bag. It&#8217;s well made, capacious, and water-resistant. Elina liked it so much that she bought the same one.

However, I&#8217;ve always been a little suspicious of the clips. They&#8217;ve never seemed quite as secure as I&#8217;d like, and my prior bag, a convertible tote which used the same clips, actually came off the bike a couple of times while traversing the streets of Manhattan. I was lucky each time in that my bag wasn&#8217;t run over by any cars, but they were close calls.

Yesterday was the closest call yet: while biking to work, I hit a bump at high speed, and the bag flew off my bike onto the street, right in front of an oncoming bus â€” with my laptop and iPad inside! Luckily the driver was able to stop in time, and I retrieved it. The only damage was a slight scuff on one of the corners of each device. Still, I clearly need something more secure. So I checked out Timbuk2&#8217;s current offerings, and ordered their [Tandem Bike Pannier](http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/products/accessories/bike-accessories/tandem-bike-pannier), which has bungee clips on both sides of the rack, and seems like it&#8217;ll be more secure.

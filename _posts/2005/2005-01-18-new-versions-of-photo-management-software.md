[BoingBoing](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/01/17/google_launches_pica.html) posts that [Picasa](http://www.picasa.com/index.php), Google&#8217;s free Windows-only photo management software, has been updated to version 2. If you aren&#8217;t lucky enough to be able to use iPhoto on a Mac, then I highly recommend this software. I&#8217;ve been spreading it around to many Windows users around here who&#8217;ve been dealing with their digital photos as files and folders &#8211; which patently doesn&#8217;t work. Available for download right now!

(My current opinion of Picasa, based on version 1, is that it may not be as good as Adobe&#8217;s [Photoshop Album](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshopalbum/main.html), but it&#8217;s free and PSA costs around $50. There is a free version of PSA but I&#8217;ve found it to be frustratingly hobbled. I haven&#8217;t had a chance to try Picasa 2 yet &#8211; no Windows here! So the new version might even trump the full version of PSA.)

I don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s related or not, but [Apple](http://apple.com/) recently announced an upgrade to its iLife home software suite called [iLife &#8217;05](http://apple.com/ilife/), which includes, among other significant updates, a new version of [iPhoto](http://apple.com/ilife/iphoto/), Apple&#8217;s superb photo management software. If you currently use iPhoto and find it indispensable (like us) then I highly recommend that you consider upgrading to the new version. It looks like there are some really great improvements and new features. It starts shipping this Saturday, the 22<sup>nd</sup> of January.

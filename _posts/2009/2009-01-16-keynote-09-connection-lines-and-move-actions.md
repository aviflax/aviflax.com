I just posted this to the Keynote team via Apple&#8217;s [Keynote Feedback page](http://www.apple.com/feedback/keynote.html):

> Dear Keynote Team:
> 
> Thanks so much for all the great enhancements in Keynote &#8217;09!
> 
> One of the new features that I&#8217;m most excited about is the new Connection Lines feature. This is great! I really like making diagrams in Keynote, the ability to build in one element at a time, focus on it, and then bring in the next one, can really help people connect to the ideas I&#8217;m trying to convey.
> 
> There&#8217;s one aspect of Connection Lines that I think could be improved: when an object they&#8217;re connected to moves because of a Move Action, the line doesn&#8217;t move along with it. Ideally, it really should.

> Thanks!

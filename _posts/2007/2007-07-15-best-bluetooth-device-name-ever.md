&#8220;The King of All Smartphones&#8221;

That&#8217;s the name that popped up on the screen of my Nokia 770 last winter, on the subway, when I told it to scan for Bluetooth devices.

I don&#8217;t know who you are, who bestowed this name upon your phone, but I salute you.

And yes, I&#8217;ve been sitting on this since the winter. I meant to post it then but never got around to it. And I never wrote it down anywhere in the meantime &#8211; that&#8217;s how memorable this name was.

Apparently my brain was adversely affected by the flight, because it didn&#8217;t occur to me until today to plug our [VoIP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VoIP "Voice over Internet Protocol") phone into the internet service here at Elina&#8217;s parent&#8217;s place. I may be starting to recover because it finally hit me. So as of this moment, our same old 410 number is active and working, so give us a call! We&#8217;ve got a temporary mobile as well but we can&#8217;t give that number out because it&#8217;s not ours. But if we&#8217;re not in, leave us a message and we&#8217;ll call you back!
  
Happy Phoning!

[David Heinemeier Hansson](http://www.loudthinking.com/) of [37 Signals](http://www.37signals.com) and [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.com) fame just posted an interesting essay:
  
[Reduce the risk, hire from open source](http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000505.html).

It&#8217;s notable because I&#8217;ve been thinking some similar thoughts about my current (stalled) job search. If I can work it out, I think I&#8217;d rather be hired on the basis of my work &#8211; my craftsmanship &#8211; than on my interviewing skills. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I think personal interaction and communication are important. But the primary focus should be on what I can and will actually accomplish. That&#8217;s one of the reasons I&#8217;m working right now on revamping my websites &#8211; so I can have something visible to demonstrate what I do, how I do it, and why I do it the way I do. I&#8217;m not just going to launch the sites and leave it at that &#8211; I&#8217;m going to post blog entries on the why and the how, explaining the process.

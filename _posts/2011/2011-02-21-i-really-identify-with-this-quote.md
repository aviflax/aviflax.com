    Some of the really savvy new media efforts like Flipboard are exciting, but after the initial &#8220;wow&#8221; factor wears off, these apps mainly serve to remind me that there&#8217;s already too much good stuff to read out there, and that my life is slipping away from me in an infinite stream of interesting bits about smart animals, dumb criminals, outrageous celebs, shiny objects, funny memes, scientific discoveries, economic developments, etc..

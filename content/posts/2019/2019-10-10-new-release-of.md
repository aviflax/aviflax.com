Iâ€™ve published [a new release](https://github.com/FundingCircle/fc4-framework/releases/tag/release_2019.10.03-6bb09fb) of [FC4](https://fundingcircle.github.io/fc4-framework/), a [FLOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) framework for authoring & maintaining [C4](https://c4model.com) software architecture diagrams.

This release adds the ability to render diagrams to [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) in addition to (and even simultaneously with) [PNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics).

Thanks to [Mike Fiedler](https://about.me/miketheman) for [the feature request](https://github.com/FundingCircle/fc4-framework/issues/200) and to 
 [Simon Brown](http://simonbrown.je/) for [Structurizr](https://structurizr.com/) and [Structurizr Express](https://structurizr.com/express)!

Well, it&#8217;s been almost a year since I updated this site last, so it&#8217;s way past time
  
for some changes. I&#8217;ve moved hosting to our home server and I&#8217;m going to try to add some photo
  
galleries too. Over the next few weeks hopefully there will be a bunch of changes, as I start
  
messing with some [php](http://php.net/) stuff, including perhaps [Movable Type](http://www.moveabletype.com/), [Gallery](http://gallery.menalto.com/), and of course some random
  
home-brewed code.

As far as our actual lives go, we just got back from vacation in [Israel](galleries/2004/IsraelJanuary/Israel2.html). We had a really amazing trip! It was even worth the nasty colds we both contracted on the flight home.

Now all we have to do is get back to the real world. Today was the first day of classes for Elina, but luckily school was canceled due to some snow. Hopefully we&#8217;ll both be feeling well enough to go to school/work tomorrow.

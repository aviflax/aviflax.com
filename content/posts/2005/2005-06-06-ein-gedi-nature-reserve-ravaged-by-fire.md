[Haaretz](http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/582820.html) reports that about two thirds of the Nahal David nature reserve has been destroyed by a fire that was caused by visitor carelessness &#8211; according to [the Jerusalem Post](http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&cid=1117506028629) it was a cigarette.

This is a huge shame. We took [our families](http://flaxfamily.com/post/everybody-at-ein-gedi/) hiking here twice in the past year and it was a beautiful reserve marred only by overcrowding and thoughtless visitors. Now that tragedy is acutely and horribly underlined for all to see. And the local flora and fauna suffer the worst.

This is just one more example of damage caused by thoughtless smokers. Careless disposal of cigarettes has always been one of my central problems with smokers &#8211; and this tragedy illustrates just how bad the results can be.

This is a case where I think cultural attitude could be prodded to advance by law and strict law enforcement. A NIS 200 fine for every single cigarette thrown to the smoker&#8217;s feet would go far to change the currently prevalent tolerance to smokers littering.

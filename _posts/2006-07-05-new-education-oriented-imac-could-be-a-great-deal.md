Since Apple discontinued the eMac a few months ago, their lineup has been conspicuously missing a budget-level K-12-classroom-oriented desktop model. Now [MacRumors reports](http://www.macrumors.com/pages/2006/07/20060705092627.shtml) on a new education-store-only low-end version of the iMac.

This is a 17&#8243; iMac with a few differences from the standard config:

All other features are identical. Obviously it&#8217;s lower-spec, but it&#8217;s $300 cheaper &#8212; seems reasonable to me.

Personally, I wouldn&#8217;t be satisfied with the lower-spec model, but I&#8217;m not the target. It&#8217;s more than capable of everything a K-12 classroom needs, and would continue to be for a few years at least. And for a school, $300 per unit can add up fast!

This is a good move on Apple&#8217;s part.

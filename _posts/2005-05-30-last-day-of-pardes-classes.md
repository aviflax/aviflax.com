Even though I will be at Pardes tomorrow for the farewell lunch, today was really the last day because it was my last day of classes. It was a pleasantly normal day; most classes were business as usual until the very end. I think I like that.

In Daniel Roth&#8217;s <em title="bible">humash</em> class, Damien gave the last presentation of the year (on Melkitzedek) and then Jordan, Yael, and I spoke about how we had changed and grown through the class and Pardes. Daniel&#8217;s final words fittingly took the form of one last lesson, he even gave out source sheets.

David Levin-Kruss&#8217;s final <em title="Maimonides">Rambam</em> class focused on the resurrection of the dead and the world to come. Not a favorite topic, but DLK always finds a way to make something interesting and personally relevant. We all then mentioned something that we had personally gained from the class, I said that I had learned that there has never been a single authoritative Jewish conception of God, or even on many aspects of our theology, and that I&#8217;m glad to have learned it.

My last class of the year was Tzvi Hirschfeld&#8217;s Seminar on Jewish Thought. We were finishing up presentations on our fourth and final topic, Feminism and Judaism. I presented last. My presentation was in essay form and I had a lot of fun writing it and reading it, and I was happy with how it turned out &#8211; the content and the style. After all the students had finished, Tzvi presented his personal views on all the topics we had studied throughout the term, which was a nice way to end the class.

It&#8217;s kinda unreal that this year of study is over already; sometimes I feel as though it has hardly begun. Still, I leave with some measure of satisfaction, aware that I have gained immensely from this year&#8217;s studies. It&#8217;s been a wonderful and amazing year, and I&#8217;ve been truly privileged to have been able to study with this singular group of teachers and students.

Somehow those words don&#8217;t feel quite adequate to express what I&#8217;m feeling â€“ but it&#8217;s late, so they&#8217;ll have to do.

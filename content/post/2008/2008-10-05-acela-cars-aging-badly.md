title: Acela Cars Aging Badly?

I&#8217;m on an Acela train right now, and it&#8217;s not the smooth, quiet ride I&#8217;m used to. Instead there&#8217;s quite a racket of shaking, squeaking, and creaking going on in here. It makes me wonder: were the Acela cars not built very well? Or is Amtrak not maintaining them well? No matter the cause, it&#8217;s a shame. I wish Congress would stop being stupid and actually fund Amtrak in a serious way â€“ the $1 billion plan that was recently approved is a paltry amount, compared to what it should be, and doesn&#8217;t even actually allocate the funds.

Elina gave me this excellent set of headphones designed expressly for the iPhone, with a microphone and control button, for my birthday &#8211; thanks babe! Although in-ears aren&#8217;t my favorite type of headphones, these are light-years ahead of the crappy earbuds that Apple shamelessly includes with the phone.

Pros:

  * great sound
  * highly custamizable fit
  * good passive attenuation of ambient sound
  * separate microphone and control button makes both more convenient and effective
  * high quality materials and construction
  * iPhone-specific plug

Cons: 

  * can hear cord bouncing around as I walk, I think this is called subharmonics, I find it really annoying, but I think it&#8217;s a general problem with all &#8220;canalphones&#8221;, not just these.
  * The phones seal really well, and don&#8217;t feed any of my voice into the audio, so I can&#8217;t hear myself speak, so I end up speaking very loudly &#8211; good for callers hearing mr, disconcerting for myself and people around me.
  * callers hear a lot of ambient noise when I&#8217;m out on the street. (but I am in new york)

Bottom line: excellent headphones with a few quirks, which shine where it matters. And a great gift. Thanks Elina!

This comes from an assignment from [David Levin-Kruss](http://www.pardes.org.il/about/faculty/#dlk), one of my favorite teachers, in his _Maimonedes&#8217; 13 Principles of Faith_ class at [Pardes](http://www.pardes.org.il/).

We were studying the principle on the messiah, and near the end, David said he had a treat for us &#8211; he asked us to draw the messiah.

I drew this:

<img src="http://flaxfamily.com/uploads/AviFlaxMessiah400.jpg" alt="The Messiah by Avi Flax" width="400" height="520" />

It&#8217;s supposed to be the Hebrew letter <span style="font-size: 175%; font-weight: bold;">&#1488;</span> (_aleph_) with a mirror image.

The idea is twofold:

  * &#1488; stands for &#1488;&#1504;&#1497;, &#1488;&#1504;&#1495;&#1504;&#1493;, &#1488;&#1514;&#1501;; _(anee, anakhnu, atem)_; I, You, We.
  * If you want to see what the messiah looks like &#8211; look in a mirror.

These ideas fit my own personal understanding as _messiah_ being more of an age than a person. Given that, if we want to reach it, then **we** have to make it happen. It&#8217;s up to us. I, You, We.

I may not be able to actually draw but it was a fun exercise!

I just stumbled across this discussion at Amazon: [Do you know about the health risks linked with the consumption of cow&#8217;s milk?](http://www.amazon.com/tag/health/forum/ref=cm_cd_dp_rt_tft_tp?%5Fencoding=UTF8&cdForum=Fx1EO24KZG65FCB&cdThread=Tx1TWMQPVZJR8MA). The discussion is two months old, has 715 posts from 119 people, and the most recent post was 2 hours ago as of this writing.

I find it fascinating – amazing, actually – that as advanced as our species is, we have yet to achieve consensus on some fundamental aspects of how we work. I think it&#8217;s a good reminder of just how far we have to go. And that Michael Pollan&#8217;s observation in his brilliant essay [Unhappy Meals](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/magazine/28nutritionism.t.html) that we still don&#8217;t have this stuff figured out, and that, in general, we&#8217;re best off eating &#8220;according to the rules of a traditional food culture&#8221; rather than following the latest nutritional trends in health science.

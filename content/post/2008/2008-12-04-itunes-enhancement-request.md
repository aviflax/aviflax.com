I just submitted the following to Apple on their [iTunes Feedback](http://www.apple.com/feedback/itunesapp.html) page:

> Subject: Please enable on-the-fly conversion when syncing
> 
> Much of the music in my library is in Apple Lossless format, but that means I can&#8217;t fit much of it on my iPhone. My options are to either live with it or convert some albums to MP3, meaning I&#8217;ve got duplicate data in my library taking up space on my laptop.
> 
> Please make it possible to have iTunes convert Apple Lossless files to MP3 on-the-fly while syncing to my iPhone! I understand that this can make syncs take much more time, but I&#8217;m cool with that. And if you need to hide the feature somehow, or just put it into an &#8220;advanced&#8221; section, that&#8217;s fine.

> Thanks!

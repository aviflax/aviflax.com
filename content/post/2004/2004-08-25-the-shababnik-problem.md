Interesting [article](http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/23279/format/html/displaystory.html) from J, &#8220;the Jewish news weekly of Northern California&#8221; about Yeshiva dropouts acting out.

I wonder if the writer is being an alarmist or if the problem is really that bad.

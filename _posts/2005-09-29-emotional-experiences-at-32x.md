Want to try something moving, and maybe a little shocking? Find a movie you love, something that moves you every time you see it, something that gets you involved emotionally. Put it into your Mac and start it playing in DVD Player. Then open the Controls menu and change the Scan Rate to 32X. Open the Controls menu again and click &#8220;Scan Forward.&#8221; Now watch your film at 32 times the normal speed.

I just did this with [Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind](http://imdb.com/title/tt0338013/) &#8211; a film that Elina and I both cherish. The movie is normally 1 hour, 43 minutes long. I just saw the entire thing in 3.2 minutes. It was crazy. As I watched it I compressed the emotional experiences that usually can hardly fit into 103 minutes, into 3.2. I was swept up into it; each scene burst over me like a wave crashing down. It was intense.

Highly recommended if you could use a shakeup, something to move you. I think it would probably only work with a film that you know really well, that you have some emotional investment in.

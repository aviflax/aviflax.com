I just wrote this to a co-worker:

> &#8230;that said, Oxygen is great for much more than just XQuery. I&#8217;m utterly convinced that anyone who works with XML should be using it. It just completely outclasses all of its competition. I want to start an Oxygen fan club!

I think that&#8217;s fairly clear. If you work with XML, XSLT, XPath, XQuery, etc, then I highly recommend that you give [<oXygen/>](http://oxygenxml.com/) a try.

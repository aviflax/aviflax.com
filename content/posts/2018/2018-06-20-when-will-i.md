title: When will I learn?

Yet another painful reminder today that changes to complex systems — those made of code and those made of people — must be broken down into the smallest, most incremental steps possible, and deployed independently, or much pain will ensue.

I’ve been doing this work — designing, building, documenting, operating, and maintaining systems made out of code and/or people — for over 20 years now, and I have yet to learn this lesson deeply enough to have it be ingrained and automatic. I don’t know if I ever will. It’s clearly hard for me to resist the power and drama of big changes. I’m not going to give up though — not yet.

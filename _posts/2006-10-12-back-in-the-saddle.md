I just got back from a quick two laps around the park on my new Bianchi Axis, which I picked up Monday morning from the Bicycle Station. It&#8217;s a really great bike! It&#8217;s very fast and very light. It&#8217;s quite different from my previous bikes; being that it&#8217;s a cyclocross bike and it&#8217;s just in general much more &#8220;serious&#8221; than I&#8217;ve had before. So I have to get used to a different riding position, wearing those cute little bicycle shoes and having my feet connected to the pedals, a very different sort of seat, and more. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll get settled soon; I&#8217;m looking forward to riding it more.

Next week I hope to get a cycle computer hooked up to the bike, so I can start tracking my mileage. Once that&#8217;s done, I&#8217;m planning to set a weekly goal for myself of 40 miles. I think that&#8217;s doable, given that my office is about 5 miles away from home. If I bike to work three days a week, that&#8217;ll be about 30 miles. Then I&#8217;ll have two other workdays to get the extra 10 in, or Sunday if need be. I think that two or three months of that will help me start getting back into shape. In about a month, I&#8217;ll want to start adding in some basic strength training. But for now, one thing at a time.

The only problem might be weather; I may need to get some special gear to help me keep riding when temperatures fall below 45 or so. So be it; I think I&#8217;m up for this challenge.

I bought this bike because my last one was stolen; so this time I&#8217;m using a ridiculously super-heavy-duty Kryptonite chain lock that I think may actually be just as heavy as the bike itself. It&#8217;s necessary though, because (1) this is a conspicuously expensive bike, and (2) the building my office is in won&#8217;t let me take the bike into the office, so when I commute to work it&#8217;s locked up outside all day, in midtown Manhattan.

In other news, שמיני אצרת and שימחת תורה are starting tomorrow night; we may have some guests so we gotta go do some shopping and cooking and cleaning, etc.

חג שמח!

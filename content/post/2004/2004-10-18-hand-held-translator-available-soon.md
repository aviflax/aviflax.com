Via [Gizmodo](http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/multilingual-023582.php) an [article at New Scientist](http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99996503) reveals that NEC will soon be selling a hand-held device that can act as a translator, so an English-speaker and a Japanese-speaker can converse in realtime with no human translator required. It&#8217;s about the size of a PDA, and here&#8217;s how it works: you speak a sentence, and about one second after you finish speaking the device audibly says what you said, in the target language.

Nice. I knew this was coming, I just didn&#8217;t know when. It&#8217;s nice to be right sooner rather than later.

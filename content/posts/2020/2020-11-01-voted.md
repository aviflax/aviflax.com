Voted! At the federal level, for Biden+Harris and Mondaire Jones, on the Working Families ticket.

What a relief! I’ve been feeling anxious about the political situation here, and it helps to know that I’ve cast my ballot.

If you’re a citizen, **please vote**, and **vote for Biden+Harris!** They will do a drastically better job at protecting the health, security, welfare, and future of the people of the USA than any other candidates.

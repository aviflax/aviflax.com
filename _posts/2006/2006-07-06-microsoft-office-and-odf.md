Brian Jones, a Microsoft Office program manager, has [shared his thoughts](http://blogs.msdn.com/brian_jones/archive/2006/07/05/657510.aspx) on Microsoft&#8217;s new program to develop a plugin for Office 2007 which will enable Office to read and write [OpenDocument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument) (ODF) files natively. This is great news for software users everywhere. It significantly levels the playing field for [OpenOffice](http://openoffice.org) and other up-and-coming document-centric software. I also like how they&#8217;re doing it &#8212; Open Source, hosted on [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/odf-converter), and this tidbit:

> Another cool piece of this is that it will also work in older versions of Office. This is because the tools leverage the Open XML support, and we&#8217;re providing free updates to previous versions of Office that allow them to read and write Open XML. It&#8217;s another great benefit of leveraging the Open XML formats for the tool.

Good stuff!

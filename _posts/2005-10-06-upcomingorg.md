I just signed up for [Upcoming.org](http://upcoming.org/) &#8211; a social events system that was created by some well-known internet innovators and was just acquired by [Yahoo!](http://yahoo.com/)

Looks promising, so far I&#8217;m impressed. Check out [my events](http://upcoming.org/user/25633/) &#8211; you can subscribe to events with RSS and iCal, watch &#8220;Metros&#8221; and designate friends.

I&#8217;ve been using Zipcar for a few years now, and one of my favorite aspects of it is that I get to drive different cars. For at least 3 years, one of my favorite cars to reserve has been the Mazda 3. Considering its price, it&#8217;s been a fantastic car — fun, refined, and convenient. Every time I&#8217;ve driven one, I&#8217;ve been amazed by how well it drives, considering its market segment. It handles _really_ well — it&#8217;s always a blast to drive. The drivetrain&#8217;s OK, but the handling has obviously been the highlight of the car.

So I was excited when I found that the 3 I&#8217;d reserved yesterday turned out to be a new 2010 model. I was looking forward to see what improvements Mazda had made. I was prepared to overlook how they&#8217;d ruined the formerly-refined exterior design, if the handling or the drivetrain were better.

Unfortunately, a few minutes on the road made clear that Mazda has bungled this one. The 2010 model is a step backward in almost every way. It doesn&#8217;t handle nearly as well — where the previous model had a tight, taut road feel, the new one is bouncy and disconnected. And the drivetrain, never the star of the show, is also a step backwards. The accelerator has a touchy, non-linear progression which makes it difficult to launch smoothly. Low-end torque is not great, the automatic transmission is slow to downshift and not particularly smooth, and to top it all off, the engine sounds like a burbly little toy. Sad.

I&#8217;d say the only improvement that the 2010 model has over the previous generation is the interior. It&#8217;s a bit nicer. But really, the previous one was great. Didn&#8217;t really need changing. The only change that I actually appreciate is the new sound system. It&#8217;s definitely a step up. Misplaced priorities at Mazda, I guess.

I still hold some hope for the MazdaSpeed 3. I drove a 2009 model and it was amazingly fantastic. Perhaps Mazda has managed to preserve the awesomeness of the Speed. I hope so.

So, anyone who&#8217;s considering buying a new Mazda 3 would be better off looking for a 2009 model. Hopefully some dealers still have some in stock. And if you&#8217;re in the market for a used car that&#8217;s reliable, fun to drive, affordable, and refined, the 2006–2009 Mazda 3 is a winner. And to maximize your fun, check out the MazdaSpeed 3. The previous-generation was fantastic. The 2010 might have retained the magic — I hope to find out soon.

We saw [The Incredibles](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317705/) last night, and it was [GREAT!](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/incredibles/) &#8211; really fun, creative, exciting, suspensful, witty, and touching. The music was superb, and the film had tons of connections to James Bond, Star Wars, Marvel & DC comics, TV action cartoons, Johnny Quest, and more. Great for kids and adults. But don&#8217;t listen to me, read the reviews. Go see it!

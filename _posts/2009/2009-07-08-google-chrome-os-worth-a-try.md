Google [just announced](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/introducing-google-chrome-os.html) its long-rumored computer operating system, Chrome OS. There&#8217;s not much real insight or analysis I can add to the insanity that the tech web just melted down into. But I can throw my 2¢ into the churn. I&#8217;m excited. I like the ideas and the philosophy behind it. But more importantly, I see this as a very positive development for a few simple reasons: competition, innovation, and choice. Google is innovating in the &#8220;basic computer&#8221; space, which is leading to increased choice and increased competition, which will lead to yet more innovation, leading to yet more choice and competition. It&#8217;s a vicious, virtuous, vital, beautiful cycle, and it has only positive implications for the future of everyday computing.

I&#8217;m looking forward to Chrome OS. It promises to be radically faster and simpler than all of the currently popular operating systems. I&#8217;m hoping it actually delivers on that promise, I think it&#8217;ll be good for computing!

OK, I was going to end the post there, but my (business) partner Tim just informed that I _do_ have some insight and analysis I can throw into the ring. He asked me: if Google&#8217;s vision of the future of computing _is_ the web, and they already have their own browser, why would they build their own OS? Aren&#8217;t browsers the gateway to the web? Here&#8217;s how I replied:

The key to understanding this is in the name of the browser and the OS: &#8220;Chrome.&#8221; In computing, &#8220;chrome&#8221; is &#8220;the borders and widgets that frame the content part of a window&#8221; ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome)) — in other words, it&#8217;s the stuff _around_ the stuff that _really_ matters — the &#8220;content&#8221; — the document, messages, information, movie, pictures, etc that you&#8217;re reading, writing, watching, editing, or otherwise interacting with. It&#8217;s become a common wisdom in user interface design that chrome must be minimized, to the point where it&#8217;s invisible, if possible. (I suspect [Edward Tufte](http://www.edwardtufte.com/) has been one of the supporters of that philosophy, but I don&#8217;t have any sources handy.)

With that understanding, Google&#8217;s philosophy seems clear to me. By naming their browser, and now their OS, after the stuff that _doesn&#8217;t really matter_, they&#8217;re revealing their thinking about what _does_ really matter: the web. So this new OS is about delivering the experience of the web unshackled by the complexity that the modern operating system is weighed down by.

I apologize, but to continue I need to take a moment to talk about what the term &#8220;operating system&#8221; means. There have always been different definitions of the term. To many, it&#8217;s all the stuff that&#8217;s included with your average copy of Windows, OS X, or a Linux distribution: a file manager, notepad, calculator, control panel, web browser, email program, etc, etc, etc. But technically, those are all actually just applications which are bundled along with the OS; the OS itself is the code which manages the hardware, and provides an abstract interface to those applications, so they themselves don&#8217;t need to worry about the vagaries of hardware. But since the term OS has fractured over time, a new term arose to describe that core part of an OS: it&#8217;s called the kernel. A modern kernel, along with integrated extensions and drivers, handles important things like hardware resource allocation, memory management, power management, networking, and all the other low-level tasks which are kinda boring but also critical to an effective computing experience.

Sundar Pichai, Google&#8217;s VP of Product Management and Linus Upson, its Engineering Director, wrote in their announcement: &#8220;The software architecture is simple — Google Chrome running within a new windowing system on top of a Linux kernel.&#8221; This sounds innocuous enough, but it&#8217;s really a radical challenge to all the mainstream operating systems available today. Windows, OS X, and the mainstream Linux distributions all have a kind of a kitchen sink approach; they include a kernel, and a windowing system, but they all also include much, much, much more — complex file systems, file managers, outmoded and ineffective security models, thousands of device drivers for devices most people never use, and hundreds and hundreds of bundled applications — they&#8217;re trying to be all things for all people. Chrome OS is a challenge to that entire model, and if Google manages to pull it off, it may be an end to there being a single dominant model for how end-user &#8220;desktop&#8221; computers work. (By &#8220;desktop&#8221; I mean any and all descendants of the typewriter-based terminal model, centered around a keyboard, including laptops.)

Essentially, the philosophy behind Chrome OS is for it to contain only the bare minimum of systems necessary to boot up the hardware, connect it to the network, and load up the web. Just about everything else just won&#8217;t be there. Sure, that won&#8217;t work for some people — but my guess is that it _will_ work for a whole bunch more. And by radically simplifying the software stack, that stack can be radically faster, more reliable, and more secure. Sounds worth a try to me.

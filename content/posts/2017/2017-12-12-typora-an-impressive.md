I just discovered [Typora](https://typora.io/), an impressive Markdown editor/viewer, via [Chad Moore](http://chadmoore.net/2017/12/10/side-hustle.html), and it’s really compelling — I think I’ll add it in to my mix, right between the lightness of nvAlt and the focusing power of FoldingText.

Also of note: I discovered it via [a discussion on Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/eli/219868) between [@eli](https://micro.blog/eli) and [@cm](https://micro.blog/cm).

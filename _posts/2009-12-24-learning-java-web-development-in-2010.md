I just noticed [this question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1958808/java-web-development-what-skills-do-i-need) by [mrblah](http://stackoverflow.com/users/68183/mrblah) at Stack Overflow:

> I want to learn, at least at a basic level, how to build java web applications (coming from a .net background).
> 
> Meaning, I would like to be able to build, deploy a simple cms type application from the ground up.
> 
> What exactly do I need to learn?
> 
> Tomcat seems to be a good web server for Java.
> 
> What options are there for the web? I know there is hibernate for an ORM.
> 
> Does java have MVC? what about JSP? can MVC and JSP be together? beans?
> 
> Maybe a book that covers all of these? 

And [an answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1958808/java-web-development-what-skills-do-i-need/1959016#1959016) popped into my head:

> I consider most of the traditional Java web development options to be pretty heavy-weight, and there some good alternatives:
> 
>   * <a href="http://www.playframework.org/" rel="nofollow">Play</a> is an MVC framework which is focused on being lightweight, straightforward, and enabling rapid development — while sticking with pure Java, as opposed to a more dynamic JVM-based language. It&#8217;s fairly new but already impressive, and a good community has built up around it quickly.
> 
>   * <a href="http://www.grails.org/" rel="nofollow">Grails</a> is an MVC framework, inspired by Ruby on Rails, which is written in, and uses, <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/" rel="nofollow">Groovy</a>, a Java-based scripting language. Grails is mature, robust, and widely respected, with a strong community. Groovy is basically a superset of Java, with better syntax and some great features such as closures, so learning it is a great way to learn Java.
> 
>   * If you need/want to build RESTful web sites/services/applications, <a href="http://restlet.org" rel="nofollow">Restlet</a> is a fantastic framework — I&#8217;m a big fan. It&#8217;s simple, straightforward, and yet flexible. Great community too.
> 
>   * <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/" rel="nofollow">Google&#8217;s App Engine</a> is an interesting option as well. It&#8217;s hosted, which may or may not be of interest, but it has a fairly simple API, and a good SDK.
> 
> I&#8217;m sure there are others, but these are the ones I can think of off the top of my head.

> Good luck, and have fun!

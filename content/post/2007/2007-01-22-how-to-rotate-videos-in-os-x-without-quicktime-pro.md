Many compact point-and-shoot digital cameras can now shoot high-quality video, with some approaching the quality of a DV video camera. This is great, but there are a few snags that can arise. In particular, people who are using to shooting stills may mistakenly rotate the camera and shoot the video in portrait orientation. They&#8217;ll get the shot, but the resulting video file will be sideways.

If you have one of these files and want to use it in a project, you&#8217;ll have to download some software; iMovie can&#8217;t rotate. Google found me some tips on using QuickTime Pro, but who wants to pay $30 just for this one function? Not me!

Short answer: use [BitPlayer](http://www.tanjero.com/bitplayer/).

Long answer:

  1. Open the video in BitPlayer.
  2. Open the &#8220;Info&#8221; window by either: 
      * In the &#8220;Window&#8221; menu, choose &#8220;Show Info&#8221;
      * Press &#8984;I (command-I)
      * Ctrl-Click or Right-Click on the video in the playlist and choose &#8220;Show Info&#8221;
      * Open the &#8220;View&#8221; tab
      * Click one of the arrow buttons next to &#8220;Orientation&#8221;. This will rotate the video, but only in BitPlayer.
      * Play the video for a few seconds to make sure it looks right.
      * In the &#8220;File&#8221; menu, choose &#8220;Export Movie&#8221;
      * Choose a location for the new movie and options for the export. 
          * The format options can be crazy-deep, so I can&#8217;t really help you there, except: if you&#8217;re planning to use the video in iMovie, and/or don&#8217;t want to take much time for compression, choose &#8220;DV Stream&#8221; as the format. If you want to export for distribution (web, etc), choose &#8220;QuickTime Movie&#8221;.</ol>

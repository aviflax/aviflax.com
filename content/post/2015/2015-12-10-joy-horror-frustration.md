I’m feeling joy for [the ~13MM Chinese shadow people who will finally be granted citizenship](https://news.google.com/news/i/story?ncl=dzA22y6Wq81EsvMck2v91uS2RxftM&q=china+one+child+policy&lr=English&hl=en), but also horror at the magnitude of the injustice perpetrated by China’s leaders against these people. And also frustration that some people who care about human rights focus so much more on the situation of the Arabs of the West Bank than other larger injustices around the world. I also yearn deeply to root out injustice, but singling out Israel’s actions to a degree out of proportion to their scope is just anti-Semitism masked in righteous rhetoric.

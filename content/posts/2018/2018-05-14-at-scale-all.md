From the slides:

> At scale, all problems become people problems.

From the transcript:

> Software is just incidental, if you really think about it. It’s bridging a gap between two populations of human beings. That definitely or obviously cannot be the main focus. If your problems are people problems, the solutions are not technical solutions, they’re also people solutions. You solve them with people.

Our new camera &#8211; a [Canon PowerShot SD300](http://dpreview.com/reviews/canonsd300/) &#8211; came in tonight to replace our lost [Pentax Optio S4](http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/specs/Pentax/pentax_optios4.asp). **Thanks** to [Mom](http://flaxfamily.com/gallery/family/IMGP1865) for picking it up, [Mommy & Daddy](http://flaxfamily.com/gallery/appolonia/IMGP2891) for packing it, and [Andy](http://flaxfamily.com/gallery/hangingout/IMG_0031) & [Lisa](http://flaxfamily.com/gallery/hangingout/IMG_0035) for bringing it across the Atlantic for us!

Here&#8217;s some unretouched full-res photos:

We&#8217;ve only had it for a few hours, but we&#8217;re already very happy with the camera. In size it&#8217;s nearly identical to our Pentax and the image quality is comparable, but it takes much higher quality video, has an orientation sensor and a focus-assist light, and a larger, sharper screen. Highly recommended! If you do buy one, then I suggest you also purchase the [Canon Accessory Kit](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00065L5SK/) which only Amazon and [Adorama](http://adorama.com) seem to carry. It&#8217;s a good deal. Finally a high-speed SD card is recommended, at least 1GB to store a useful amount of video footage.

And of course Andy & Lisa are in town, we hung out with them after Shabbat, great to see them! Everyone else in the US should come visit! This means you!

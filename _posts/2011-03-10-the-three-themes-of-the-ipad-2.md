The iPad 2 will be going on sale tomorrow, and I&#8217;ve read enough reviews and analyses of the device to judge that there&#8217;s something being missed. Most reviews, and Apple&#8217;s marketing, simple discuss each improvement individually, or discuss the overall experience of using the device — but I haven&#8217;t seen anyone try to sum up the changes thematically, to enable a succinct high-level summary of what the iPad 2 is all about.

Three themes encompass the various improvements embodied in the iPad 2 and its accessories: speed, power, and ergonomics.

I don&#8217;t think I need to explain &#8220;speed&#8221; at all. By &#8220;power&#8221; I mean the ability to do things which weren&#8217;t possible or practical before; this includes the cameras, the gyroscope, the Verizon-compatible 3G radio, and the faster CPU and GPU — there’s some overlap between speed and power. I&#8217;m excited about those themes, but they&#8217;re pretty straightforward. I suspect that &#8220;ergonomics&#8221; requires more explanation.

The iPad 2 has many ergonomic improvements: lighter, thinner, rounded edges, flatter back, and the Smart Covers. These advances together will make the iPad 2 a significantly better experience than the first iPad. Being lighter and thinner means it&#8217;s easier to grasp in one hand with less fatigue over time. The flatter back means it&#8217;ll work much better on a flat surface such as a table or desk without a case or stand — the curved back of the first iPad made a case or stand essential. The Smart Covers will also enable more frequent use of the iPad without a case, because they&#8217;re so quick and easy to remove.

Combined together, we have a device which will be much easier and more pleasant to use without a case, more likely to be used without a case, and which when held in one hand will frequently be significantly lighter.

I understand why Apple wouldn&#8217;t market the iPad 2 using these themes; they&#8217;re too abstract for marketing. People generally want to hear about concrete improvements in new models. But there&#8217;s value in identifying and understanding the themes embodied in a new version of a product, so as to be able to make a holistic comparison with the older version.

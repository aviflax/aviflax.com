It didn&#8217;t always feel really real until now: we finally bought airline tickets! We&#8217;re flying El Al direct, departing from Newark on Sunday, July 18th at 2:30 PM &#8211; arriving in Tel Aviv July 19th at 8:10 AM (Israel time). I&#8217;m REALLY excited!

Anyone want to rent a nice 3-bedroom house for a year?

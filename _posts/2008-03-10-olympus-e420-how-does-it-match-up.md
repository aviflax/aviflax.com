My co-worker [Jess](http://jesseddy.com/) recently [noted](http://jesseddy.com/blog/?p=88) the announcement of the new Olympus Evolt E420 digital SLR.

The E420 looks sweet indeed. However, I&#8217;m not sure about it being &#8220;the smallest camera with the highest photo quality&#8221;.

Let&#8217;s compare it with a few other cameras:

The M8 has a larger sensor and is smaller than the E420, while the GR Digital II is super-small and super-light, but has a small sensor. If money&#8217;s no object, the M8 looks like it might have the best shot at &#8220;the highest photo quality&#8221; out of this lot. However, it&#8217;s quite pricey, and a rangefinder (which is manual-focus only) isn&#8217;t for everyone. In that case, the GR Digital II may not achieve quite the absolute quality of the E420, but people have been getting some great results out of it, and it is quite a bit smaller.

BTW, Jess, in case you don&#8217;t know, our fellow Arc90-er [Alex](http://flickr.com/photos/gutierreza/) has the GR Digital II, and I get the impression that he&#8217;s pretty happy with it. You might want to ask him if you can play with it, if you&#8217;re interested.

**Update:** Added Sigma DP-1 as suggested by David. Looks like a strong option &#8211; although I have to say I don&#8217;t know much about Sigma&#8217;s cameras; I haven&#8217;t read much by people who use them, or even seen many samples.

**Update 2:** Clarified specs of GR Digital II lens.

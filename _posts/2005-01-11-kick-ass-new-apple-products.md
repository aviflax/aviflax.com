Time to warm that credit card up!

The biggest news to my mind is the new Mac mini &#8211; $500 for the cheapest, smallest Mac ever. It&#8217;s a truly revolutionary product:

That&#8217;s the whole thing. Here&#8217;s what it looks like on a desk:

The thing on the left is the computer. On the right is one of the new iPod shuffles. Check out the dimensions:

It&#8217;s tiny! You can stack 7 or 8 of them in space of a standard PC:

The cheapest Mac ever will let PC users switch over with a much smaller cash outlay &#8211; $500 for the computer, plug in your current monitor, keyboard, mouse and speakers, and you&#8217;re good to go! And it&#8217;s _really_ tiny! 2 inches tall! And it weighs 2.9 pounds! And you can add Bluetooth! WiFi! DVD Burner! Wow! Don&#8217;t miss the [photo gallery](http://www.apple.com.nyud.net:8090/macmini/gallery/).

_Update:_Rob of [MacOSXHints](http://macosxhints/) has posted a great [photo gallery](http://www.macosxhints.com/images/mwsf05/pix/index.html) from MacWorld, which includes the following shot of his hand grasping a Mac mini:

The other new products are major news too! Here&#8217;s some highlights:

  * [The iPod shuffle](http://www.apple.com.nyud.net:8090/ipodshuffle/)
  
    Ultra-tiny iPod &#8211; $99 for the 512MB model, $149 for 1GB. Not my speed, but I&#8217;m sure it will be very popular &#8211; especially for athletics.
  * [iLife &#8217;05](http://www.apple.com.nyud.net:8090/ilife/)
  
    New versions of [iPhoto](http://www.apple.com.nyud.net:8090/ilife/iphoto/), [iMovie](http://www.apple.com.nyud.net:8090/ilife/imovie/), [iDVD](http://www.apple.com.nyud.net:8090/ilife/idvd/), and [GarageBand](http://www.apple.com.nyud.net:8090/ilife/garageband/) should continue to revolutionize what regular people can do with technology.
  * [iWork &#8217;05](http://www.apple.com.nyud.net:8090/iwork/)  
    Bundles a new version of Apple&#8217;s acclaimed presentation software [KeyNote](http://www.apple.com.nyud.net:8090/iwork/keynote/) with Apple&#8217;s brand-new word processor [Pages](http://www.apple.com.nyud.net:8090/iwork/pages/). Looks promising! Finally Appleworks diehards have some good news! And finally a polished strong competitor to Micro$oft Word!

Wired News [reports](http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,65819,00.html) that the [Wikimedia Foundation](http://wikimediafoundation.org/) is developing a new effort: [Wikinews](http://demo.wikinews.org/wiki/Main_Page). Similar to [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org/) and [Wiktionary](http://www.wiktionary.org/wiki/Main_Page), it&#8217;s [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) based, so [anyone can edit any entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki).

This is really mind-bogglingly important. This is the beginning of a structured yet open framework that allows anyone in the world to write news to be published. I&#8217;m really excited about it; I think it&#8217;s really promising. I have a lot of thoughts about this development and what it means for our future culture but I don&#8217;t have the time to write them all out right now&#8230; maybe some other time.

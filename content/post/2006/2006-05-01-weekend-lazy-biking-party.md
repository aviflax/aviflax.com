Well, it was a fun weekend &#8212; mostly lazy around the house, reading, organizing, etc.

Sunday I rode my bike to Manhattan&#8217;s Upper West Side &#8212; 105th & Hudson River Park, for Leah & Yoni&#8217;s engagement party &#8211; Mazal Tov! &#8211; then dinner, then biked back home. Round trip: about 21-20 miles. Nice.

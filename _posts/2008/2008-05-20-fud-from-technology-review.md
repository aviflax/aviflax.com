Just posted [a comment](http://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/20801/page1/#comment-203051) in response to [Alarming Open-Source Security Holes](http://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/20801/) at MIT&#8217;s Technology Review:

> Your headline is misleading &#8211; I hope it&#8217;s an innocent mistake, as opposed to an intentional attempt to spread FUD about Open Source software. The crucial nuance that&#8217;s missing, both from the headline and the article, is that bugs such as this are **just** as likely to occur in closed-source software as in open-source &#8212; but with open-source software, they&#8217;re _far_ more likely to be discovered, sooner, precisely because the code is available for anyone to peruse!

<del datetime="2008-05-20T16:43:03+00:00">I&#8217;m not actually surprised or anything; TR has always had a corporate feel to it &#8211; it&#8217;s generally about MITers or ex-MITers making money, as opposed to pure excitement about technology.</del>

_Edit:_ Struck out the last paragraph; after Jason Pontin&#8217;s comment below, I realized that my impressions of TR are almost certainly out of date. BTW, he also responded to [my comment](http://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/20801/page1/#comment-203051); check out the discussion there.

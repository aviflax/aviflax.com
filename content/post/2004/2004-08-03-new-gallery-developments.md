In other news, Elina&#8217;s starting Ulpan today, our DSL is hooked up, our Baltimore phone line will be active in a day or two via [VoIP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VoIP) service from [MyPhoneCompany](http://www.myphonecompany.com/default.aspx?agent=6002229) (disclaimer: I&#8217;m an agent), I&#8217;m looking into some schools, we&#8217;re starting to feel settled in our apartment (photos soon), and we&#8217;re still very excited to be here!

I&#8217;m off to some free classes at [Aish HaTorah](http://www.aish.com/) with Joey &#8211; Everybody have a great day!

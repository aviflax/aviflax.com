Spent **_hours_** today configuring our new Linksys WRT54G to act as a transparent wireless bridge, so our new Linksys Sipura SPA-1001 would finally work fully &#8211; it&#8217;s been plugged into my PowerBook using Internet Sharing, which meant the PowerBook had to stay on the desk, and stay on, all the time, and incoming calls didn&#8217;t work because of the double-NAT.

When I first ordered the WRT I had intended to use it with [OpenWRT](http://www.openwrt.org/) but it turned out to be WAY too much of a pain to configure. After hours of futzing around I finally came across a forum post with instructions using [DD-WRT](http://www.dd-wrt.com/). The instructions didn&#8217;t work very well, but I found that if I installed a beta of the latest V3 version, I could finally get the box configured and working the way I wanted.

After that it only took another two hours of futzing around with stuff until everything seems to be working &#8211; incoming calls and everything.

Man, what a crappy day.

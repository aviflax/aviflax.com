Spent yesterday afternoon at [The Tea Spot](http://www.teamap.com/tearooms/tea_spot_1631.html) &#8211; quiet, good tea, free WiFi. Then Elina took the subway in to meet me and we had dinner at [Caravan of Dreams](http://www.caravanofdreams.net/). Nice!

We worked today at the [Brooklyn Public Library](http://brooklynpubliclibrary.org/) &#8211; nice and quiet, cool, and they&#8217;ve got [free wireless](http://www.brooklynpubliclibrary.org/wireless.jsp) &#8211; which didn&#8217;t happen to be working today, oh well. The central branch is about a 3 minute walk from where we&#8217;re staying here in [Park Slope](http://www.stufflikethat.org/archives/snapny/slope/page.shtml)

We&#8217;re headed out now to meet Jackie and Keith for dinner at [Mr. Broadway](http://www.mrbroadwaykosher.com/). Hopefully we&#8217;ll be hanging out with [Leah K](http://flickr.com/photos/avi4now/26019418/) and [Chaim](http://flaxfamily.com/gallery/hangingout/DSC00126?full=1) later this week.

Goodnight!

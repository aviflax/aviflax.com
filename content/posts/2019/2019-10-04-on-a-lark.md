On a lark, I just installed [Lynx](https://lynx.invisible-island.net) and used it to view [the homepage of the FC4 Framework](https://fundingcircle.github.io/fc4-framework/). It looked great! I got a real kick out of this; it took me way back. I was also pleased to see that the structure and content of the page worked well when represented in plain text.

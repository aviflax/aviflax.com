[Pardes](http://pardes.org.il/) is running some kind of marketing campaign, and they asked me if I could write a note to anyone on a list of college-related people in Maryland. I didn&#8217;t know any of them, so I just chose Rabbi Menashe of the [Johns Hopkins Hillel](http://www.jhu.edu/hillel/), thinking that maybe Baltimore could be a common point of reference.

It was only supposed to be a short note, but I wrote this:

> Dear Rabbi Menashe,
> 
> I don&#8217;t believe we&#8217;ve met, but I&#8217;m writing you at the request of my yeshiva as a fellow Baltimorean and a member of the Baltimore Jewish community, to tell you about my experience learning here at Pardes.
> 
> I am a person that grew up in the Orthodox community, and attended TA from 3rd to 12th grade, and then learned for a year at Yeshivat HaKotel. But after those experiences, at 19, I found myself dissatisfied and uninspired. I had trouble connecting to my learning and to my own religious observance &#8211; much of it seemed at odds with other more rationalistic aspects of my character. I spent six or seven years in a kind of stasis, stalled in religious growth, and conflicted.
> 
> Thus, when after I arrived in Jerusalem for a sabbatical year, I inadvertently heard about Pardes, I was well overdue in finding some way to break that condition, and resume growth and self-unification. I was excited; Pardes seemed like it might really be able to help me progress. So I enrolled &#8211; unsure of how it would work out, but with great expectations.
> 
> Today, after learning here for almost six months, I can already say that my expectations have been met and greatly exceeded. I have been stimulated, challenged, inspired, and fully engaged by an incredible group of teachers and students. I now approach Torah study and Jewish studies with an eager, focused intent and a clarity of purpose that I had only dreamed of in the past. I feel that I am finally starting to reintegrate my Jewish heritage and tradition into the center of my life, incorporating them into the essence of my existence &#8211; in a way that is exhilarating, inspiring, and life-affirming.
> 
> I&#8217;m sure that the approach and environment here at Pardes aren&#8217;t for everyone, but for myself and the other members of the vibrant student community here, it is a haven for Torah study and personal development that helps fuse a rigorous intellectual approach to study with the rich texture of our Jewish heritage. I hope you will consider recommending Torah study at Machon Pardes to any students of yours that might be interested.

> Please feel free to contact me if you&#8217;d like to ask any questions or discuss Pardes at further length. My US phone number (which rings in Jerusalem) is XXX-XXX-XXXX and my email address is XXXX.

> Thank you,

It seems that I like Pardes and what I&#8217;m doing here!

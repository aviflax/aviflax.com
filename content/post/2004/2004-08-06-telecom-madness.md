Our virtual Baltimore phone-line is now active &#8211; with our original home phone number! That&#8217;s right, the same exact phone number that we had at home in Baltimore, can now be used to reach us in Jerusalem &#8211; for the price of a local or domestic call! So, everyone feel free to call! Just remember that we&#8217;re in GMT+3 (during daylight savings time &#8211; [more info](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/city.html?n=110)) which is 7 hours ahead of US Eastern time &#8211; so please don&#8217;t call past 4 P.M. Eastern!

This works with a technology called [VoIP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VoIP) &#8211; and our current service provider is [MyPhoneCompany](http://www.myphonecompany.com/default.aspx?agent=6002229) (disclaimer: I&#8217;m an agent).

How cool is that?

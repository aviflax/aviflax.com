[Luke Maciak asked:](http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/2012/11/23/what-language-are-you-coding-in-what-language-would-you-like-to-code-in/) “What language are you coding in? What language would you like to code in?”

[My answer:](http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/2012/11/23/what-language-are-you-coding-in-what-language-would-you-like-to-code-in/comment-page-1/#comment-24182)

  <p>
    My current go-to language is Clojure, and that’s the language I’d like to learn more about and to just level-up on. However, my current project at work is written in Python. I’m not a huge fan of Python, but I do appreciate it and I can totally live with it. So I’m making the best of the situation by trying to apply what I’ve learned from Clojure to my Python code: limiting state, preferring functions over classes and methods, and preferring declarative syntax to imperative.

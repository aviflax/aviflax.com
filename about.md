I'm originally from Baltimore, Maryland, and now live in White Plains, New York with my wife and daughter.

Professionally, Iâ€™m a software designer and developer currently working at [Park Assist](http://parkassist.com/).

Some of my other interests are feminism, driving, hiking, cycling, travel, the future, Judaism, Israel, science fiction, video games, gadgets, and science.
